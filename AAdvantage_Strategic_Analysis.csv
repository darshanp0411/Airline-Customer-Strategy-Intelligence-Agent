"Not Verified |  Terrible. My family and I were forced to check our bags even though there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments for our carry ons, and our carry ons were within the size limit for the compartments. Once at the baggage claim, all of our bags eventually came out except for mine. We headed into the customer relations office to ask if they knew where my bag was, and the woman’s response was, “We’ve been waiting for you to come in here.” They then proceeded to show me that my bag had been completely shredded, and several items inside had been shredded as well. It was very obvious that they were not planning on going out of their way to show me my damaged bag or make up for the damages. I’m very disappointed with the customer service and the lack of awareness in today’s world. I will not be flying with American again.","Terrible.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever. Flight delayed then cancelled. Offered hotel voucher but one person for a line as big an aircraft capacity. Five people were helped in 2 hours. Then we got cards that says we're closed and she left. Voucher for food was $12. A hamburger is $25. Doesn't matter, they were all closed. Then delay to another gate to delayed again. We had the plane from last night. They said we could leave are bags on board. So we have a plane with no crew or pilot. Every AA employee was pretty rude and wouldn't do anything for you. I'm cancelling my AA credit card because I don't want to use American airlines ever again.","Worst experience ever. Flight delayed then cancelled.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 703 CLT to BUF was diverted to PIT on Sunday, 25 June 2023, for valid reasons. Stuff happens. Vouchers were given for a hotel and for food. A voucher was promised for travel to hotels that did not have a shuttle service. The travel confirmation texted to my phone contained a link to american-airlines-passengers.tvlinc.com/. The page to which the link led provided a registration code for the hotel and a voucher for $12 for food. In the middle of the page, it said, ""No shuttle: Transport voucher will be available after hotel is booked."" No vouchers were given at the gate in the airport. No voucher was given by the hotel. No voucher appeared in my American Airlines app. No voucher was offered today as I checked back in for the flight to BUF. We were told that all we had to do was to contact aa.com/refunds to file a claim for the travel to and from the hotel. 1. There is no option on aa.com/refunds to ask for transportation to and from the hotel. 2. A link in the support page asks whether the user would like to chat with support, but the page to which the link leads has no portal to a chat system. I do not think American Airlines is competent enough to be lying. They just do not know what they are doing. Stuff happens, but some stuff that happens is contemptible. I pass over the hour wait in PIT for a storage container to be delivered to the pantry.

"Not Verified | Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare of trying to get our flights rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements, being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency. Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster. ","Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain.

"✅ Trip Verified |  As someone who travels frequently, this was the first time I encountered a staff that didn't know how to smile or appear willing to help. This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It's not just about their lack of willingness to work; it's also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn't deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn't even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money. In any way, the time I lost, the frustration I had for a couple of days. These were all enough for me to never ever use this company. This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I am sorry that it turned out this way.","As someone who travels frequently, this was the first time I encountered a staff that didn't know how to smile or appear willing to help.

"✅ Trip Verified | I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.","I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines.

Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.",2023-04-11,LAX-JFK,Leisure,None,Staff Service,0.005689102564102563
"✅ Trip Verified |  American has quite simply taken the throne as the worst airline imaginable. Where do I even start? We board in Phoenix, AZ in June when it is 110 degrees outside and the plane is a literal sauna. Apparently the ac “wasn’t connected”. We then sit on the tarmac for an extra 25-30 minutes sweating profusely in the most uncomfortable situation. In the air, the outstandingly horrible display of an airline continued. I paid $40 for Wifi for the flight to watch the Us open golf tournament and in the least surprising news of the century - the wifi was broken for more than 75% of the flight. The cherry on top was the flight attendants ridiculous behavior. When asking for garbage I handed the man my sprite can and the cup. He only grabbed the can and the cup spilled on a passenger at the end of the row. They are having an exclusive discount on a Mastercard for 70,000 miles? What a joke. The attendants were loud on the speaker talking for at least 20 minutes trying to push this deal before the end of the month. Grand finale? They had interns on the flight deck at JFK and they moved the plane to far forward. We sat at the gate for 45 minutes before being able to get off the plane at 12 in the morning. If you offered me free flights for life on American I would say “no thank you” disgusting display of professionalism- worst airline imaginable. Should definitely take your business elsewhere","American has quite simply taken the throne as the worst airline imaginable. Where do I even start?

"Not Verified |  My family and I came from a long 12 hour long flight from overseas, which was also American Airlines (went smoothly) and when we landed in Dallas it was supposed to be a short 2 hour layover before heading to Austin. Turns out the flight kept getting delayed and delayed over and over again whether it was technical issues or due to not having a pilot to operate the plane. Originally was going to depart at 6:00 pm, was now delayed to 11:50 pm. Unbelievable. Service was mediocre at best, but overall extremely chaotic and unorganized and it would have been better to have put my money in a more competent airline. We have stayed at the airport for over 7+ hours. Please put your money in a better airline, just because it’s cheap doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it.","My family and I came from a long 12 hour long flight from overseas, which was also American Airlines (went smoothly) and when we landed in Dallas it was supposed to be a short 2 hour layover before heading to Austin.

My first flight was delayed two hours and even though I got to my connecting flight before the schedule departure time, the plane had already left. They said that we weren’t even scheduled on that flight even though we were. Their system had automatically rescheduled me without my approval because they “thought we wouldn’t make it”.

When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren’t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time.","The worst flying experience I’ve had so far.

The flights were on time, our checked baggage arrived without delay, the service on the ground and in flight was professional and courteous. The seats were typical for a US-based carrier's economy product. The IFE had many choices and was easy to navigate (though, my one complaint here is a lack of appealing music choices; I was looking for classic rock and/or 1960s and 70s pop (Beatles, Stones, Journey, Styx, Wings, ELO, etc.) and their selections included songs and artists I've never heard of). The catering was good; biscoff cookies on the domestic segments and a full meal and snacks on the trans-Atlantic segments. AA offered a choice of 2 meals on both international segments. Along with the entree, the meal tray includes a bottle of cold water, a small salad with an olive oil-based dressing, a roll with butter, crackers and cheese, and a brownie for dessert. Overall the main meals were satisfying.

We were told at the time we cancelled that we would have 1 full year from the date we cancelled to rebook new flights for our credit. We tried to rebook using our voucher within that time frame and were told for the first time that we needed to have used our credit to rebook and actually travel within one year of the date of the original ticket purchase, which was 2 months ago. What if we (like many) had purchased our tickets even further out for our international trip?

✅ Trip Verified |  I travel a lot and this was the first time on American Airlines and probably the last. Worst experience ever! First flight out of Buffalo NY was missed because of their counter woman taking over an hour with another customer and only one person at the counter. Several people misses their flights due to her. Lucky the phone customer service was able to get me on a flight with JetBlue however when I purchased my flight with American it included one bag I had to pay for my bags on JetBlue! On the return flights the on the ground customer service was horrible. I was directed to the one counter lady because she was the one that spoke English however she refused to help me because she said and I quote “ I do not speak to Americans” and the other person that didnt speak English clearly over charges me for my second bag the connecting flight from Miami to Charlotte NC seem to go smooth but once I reached Charlotte it went downhill once again. I had to spend the night at the airport for my next flight back home to Buffalo which I was aware of however when booking this trip AA assured me I would be able to comfortably rest at the gate for the evening. That was not the case and I understand they have no control of the facility but no where to stretch out other than the floor which again I have no problem with but it was freezing and I am now extremely sick probably pneumonia. I asked one of the AA clerks if they had a blanket or anything to help keep me warm as everything within the airport was closed and could not attempt to purchase one she was very rude and couldn’t be bothered. One would think of you are going to strand your customers over night at the terminal you would be a little more accommodating at keeping them comfortable. After all the cost of flights are not cheap. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service on the ground the only real complaint with the inflight was the crew from Cartagena to Miami never told us what carousal the luggage was coming out at and that was stressful as I had a connecting flight and had to go through customs with my luggage and that takes time so wasting a half hour trying to find out where it was was unacceptable.

✅ Trip Verified |  I will never recommend American Airlines! I was in the airport since 0630 on time for 0730 boarding to New York and connect to Minneapolis. However my flight cancelled and rescheduled twice which made me miss my work. I was supposed to be at work in Minneapolis at 1930. I planned my flight giving plenty of time to myself. I was hopeful to get home after 7 hr to the the latest for my night shift. All I did is seat from airport to another airport and suffer all day Monday. I finally flew from DC to Charlotte at 1:55 pm and landed around 3pm. Only option I was given is to wait till 10:56 pm flight to land at 12:37 am for extra expenses. Stop by to the customer service and asked if I can get meal voucher which took her about 30 min and even being accused for verbally threatening for her because I asked her information/I’d. she told me connecting plane was on time and told me that is my fault for not being in the right place and “we only offer one meal voucher per day” what? Ironically it was not under my control for the airlines canceling my planned flight several times a day. I have to say that I got $12 meal voucher in DC airport for the morning and she finally gave me $12 for lunch. I also have to be punished at work for calling in for 8hr night shift and lose my sick time/money for me. I am very disappointed for the whole process and end up being physically/mentally/ emotionally and financially to be drained and my time is taken away from my family. I filled a complaint online and I was rewarded 2500 mile for 11 hours of delay from my original ticket and 11 hrs of hustle and bustle - what a joke.,I will never recommend American Airlines! I was in the airport since 0630 on time for 0730 boarding to New York and connect to Minneapolis. However my flight cancelled and rescheduled twice which made me miss my work. I was supposed to be at work in Minneapolis at 1930. I planned my flight giving plenty of time to myself. I was hopeful to get home after 7 hr to the the latest for my night shift. All I did is seat from airport to another airport and suffer all day Monday. I finally flew from DC to Charlotte at 1:55 pm and landed around 3pm. Only option I was given is to wait till 10:56 pm flight to land at 12:37 am for extra expenses. Stop by to the customer service and asked if I can get meal voucher which took her about 30 min and even being accused for verbally threatening for her because I asked her information/I’d. she told me connecting plane was on time and told me that is my fault for not being in the right place and “we only offer one meal voucher per day” what? Ironically it was not under my control for the airlines canceling my planned flight several times a day. I have to say that I got $12 meal voucher in DC airport for the morning and she finally gave me $12 for lunch.

Not Verified |  Flight 2414 was scheduled to leave Dulles at 5:09 pm. We all boarded the plane and were ready to depart when the grounds crew reported a stick in the wing. We waited 10 - 15 minutes and then we were told we had to deplane because there was a bird's nest in the wing that would take 1 - 2 hours to clean out. One hour later groups 1 - 3 boarded the plane again and then we were all told that Dallas  Fort Worth had grounded all flights because of weather. I flight then let 3.5 hours late at about 8:36 pm. Upon arriving in Dallas my connecting flight had already left the airport and there were no other flights. This resulted in my wife and I having to pay for a Lyft because all the shuttles had ended at 10:30 pm. Then we had to pay for a hotel because American insisted that our flight was delayed because of the weather. I reported all of this to American Airlines customer service but they continued to insist the delay was because of weather and even if there was a bird's nest that would also be something out of the airlines control. Sorry but this is garbage. I have been a loyal American Airlines customer for years but they have devolved into an airline that does not care about their passengers.

I later sent an email for a refund or compensation for what I went through that day and night and they offered me $50. I emailed back saying that was not acceptable. I spent $250 on the ticket and thought they can do better then that. An agent then reached out and called saying since my flight was canceled I could have asked for the refund at the airport and got on another flight with another airline but there's nothing they can do now. If they would have offered me that option when this was happening I definitely would have took it. This was my first time in a long time flying with American and had a horrible experience.

I was told by the front desk lady that the fight was already closed and I had lost the flight. She sent me to the American Airlines office at the airport.

I was about one and a half hours talking to these AA reps at the airport while the plane was still there and they didn't want to check me in. Same thing happened to more than 10 passengers. This is just insane. Happen that the Cuban dictatorship have a charter plane for this same itinerary scheduled for departure three hours and a half later, and they offer you to buy a ticket for this second plane as an alternative for you to fly on the same day. My wife and myself had to buy this other flight ticket for $518.00 in order to get home that last night. I just called customer service on May 6th at at 4:00pm and the representative told me that he doesn't know what happened, but he recommends to be at the check-in point 3hrs before the flight. I requested to talk to a supervisor and the supervisor told me that I am supposed to be 2hrs sharp before the flight at the check-in point and I have to file the complaint online instead to talk to customer service. They will only give credit to fly again only from Cuba. Very disappointing.","Flight from Holguin-Cuba to Miami on May 5th scheduled for departure at 1:30pm. (AA 2726) I got to the check-in station at 11:35pm with only a carry-on and there was nobody there. I was told by the front desk lady that the fight was already closed and I had lost the flight. She sent me to the American Airlines office at the airport. At the office, the AA representative told me that ""the plane was already closed because passengers have to be at the check in point 3hrs before departure"". I was about one and a half hours talking to these AA reps at the airport while the plane was still there and they didn't want to check me in. Same thing happened to more than 10 passengers. This is just insane. Happen that the Cuban dictatorship have a charter plane for this same itinerary scheduled for departure three hours and a half later, and they offer you to buy a ticket for this second plane as an alternative for you to fly on the same day.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite the fact that when buying tickets 3 months before the date of travel, me and my wife chose our seats, 24 hours before departure American Airlines separated us and then moved us to completely different seats. Our seats were offered to another couple travelling without children or other dependents. Why? There is no logical explanation. I tried to get help online but it was some ridiculous joke. I made a complaint and the response is also just fixed formulas without any explanation or assurance for the future. Travelling with the spouse separately because AA had such a whim!

Not Verified |  The worst. First they messed up on my departure had me down to drive 2 hrs & a half to the Chicago Airport when I told them I wanted the Moline Airport since I'm closer to that one so it cost me an extra $400 to change it even though they messed it up to begin with then we were right in back of the first class people from Chicago going to San Juan & had to watch them being pampered to death with all the attention while we got none plus big meals while we got stuck having to choose off the very limited menu & eat a little snack box filled with junk food. Super cold on the plane especially flying back & they had no blankets to give out one of the female stewardesses from the Moline departure looked like she hated her job she just sat there the whole time & looked bored & miserable don't know what her problem was but wasn't too friendly. The female stewardess from San Juan flying into Chicago looked high strung & filled with anxiety that it made me feel uncomfortable. I will never fly American again & wouldn't recommend it to anyone it's expensive & you don't get what you paid for including healthy foods off the menu just a very limited one with processed chips & store bought cookies or a blanket if you're cold. ,The worst.

"✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with American Airlines and the last! Our flight out of Albuquerque was late, but we boarded an hour late and thought we would make our connecting flight. We sat for another hour in the plane and were told there was a cabin light that was not working and did not need to be fixed to fly, but the pilot chose to hold the plane up anyway. We had to run to our connecting gate at DFW. Our luggage did not get on the plane. When we got to Key West, a baggage claim employee told us we would probably not get our bags until the 4:30 flight the next day. We just questioned why as there was two earlier flights. She apparently did not like being questioned and just gave us our baggage tickets back and said there was nothing else she could do. We were getting married the next day and all our wedding attire was in those bags! We called the airline customer service the next morning and found out she never filed a baggage claim ticket tracking either and were told the bags would be on the 1:20 flight from Miami. When we went to the airport to get the bags, the baggage claim supervisor had taken our bags off the carousel, came into the terminal, called our names and we were instructed to go talk to him at the baggage claim window. He told us that Tracy had indicated we were intoxicated and using foul language when speaking to her the day before. Both of those statements were a lie. Unless American Airlines over serves their customers, there is no way we were drunk. We were on their planes from 9 am until 4:30 pm with no layovers. Secondly, my fiance does not swear, just ridiculous! He told us we had two options, either apologize to the staff or he would send our luggage with a delivery service and we would get it sometime that day. We told him we were getting married in a few hours and our wedding attire was in those bags. He said he understood, but those were our options. So he held our luggage hostage and basically forced us to apologize to the staff for something that never happened, just so we could get our luggage and get married. I would like to know where our apology is from American for ruining our entire wedding day! I cried all night and most of the next morning because we thought we were going to have to cancel our wedding.

On both flights they hustled their way through drinks and a meal offering bread, top offs etc as swiftly and kindly as possible. Considering what they are given to work with I was impressed. Apparently cost cutting leaves the employees and passengers on the short end of the stick.

I feel for the solo flight attendants working the entire cabin without assistance trying hard to be of good service. On both flights they hustled their way through drinks and a meal offering bread, top offs etc as swiftly and kindly as possible. Considering what they are given to work with I was impressed. Apparently cost cutting leaves the employees and passengers on the short end of the stick.

"Not Verified |  So, preparing for my flight, I recently bought a brand new suitcase set. They were quite nice and were not cheap by no means. The smaller bag has a numerical lock on the front. I guess at some point after I had checked my bags they felt the need to search this particular one. Well, though I am fairly certain the code was set so all they had to do was push a button to open it, this is not what happened. Instead of checking the lock, or even finding away to speak with the owner of the bag to get the code, they busted it open. Definitely weren't careful about it at all. By the time the bag made it back to me, the lock had been rigged to look like it could stay closed, though my bag was actually being held closed by tape. Once I was able to open my bag I found a little piece of paper stuck in there with a paragraph highlighted claiming that they are not liable for the damage cause to any of my items while searching my bag. I don't understand why no other actions, besides damaging my property, were taken. My bag is completely unable to be used and I still have to fly home. Now I will have to pay to have it fixed or replaced simply because they couldn't be bothered to ask a simple question.","So, preparing for my flight, I recently bought a brand new suitcase set.

Once I was able to open my bag I found a little piece of paper stuck in there with a paragraph highlighted claiming that they are not liable for the damage cause to any of my items while searching my bag. I don't understand why no other actions, besides damaging my property, were taken. My bag is completely unable to be used and I still have to fly home. Now I will have to pay to have it fixed or replaced simply because they couldn't be bothered to ask a simple question.",2024-04-28,LAX-JFK,Leisure,None,Baggage,0.0576926406926407

We had no issues valet checking at MSP however in PHX both ways they stripped the valet tag and forced it to be checked to baggage claim. I questioned why this would be and was told safety as wagons are ""too heavy"" for the workers to carry up for valet luggage, and looking at their website they apparently have unilaterally declared a ""stroller war"" and don't allow strollers > 20lbs. Good luck if you are a single parent travelling with twins! I know this wagon is quite light, much lighter than any strollers other than the umbrella stroller and asked that they simply weigh it.

"✅ Trip Verified | This was ridiculous and audacious. This was our first time with American and also our last. We flew from Munich via Charlotte to Charleston, South Carolina. On our flight from CLT to CHS, we were already about one and a half hours delayed, apparently due to an aircraft change. That in itself wasn’t nice, but if would’ve been somewhat acceptable. The real problems started on our return flight back to Munich, as we left CHS with a delay of over 2 hours. Since AAs schedule is ridiculously tight, the delay caused us (and many other passengers with connecting flights) to miss our connections. We missed our flight by a grand total of 5 minutes, because they couldn’t hold the aircraft an additional five minutes (especially since we weren’t the only ones running to catch that specific flight). We were then sent to a service desk to arrange a re-booking and initially hoped to be re-booked onto a later flight with Lufthansa or British Airways (which is a Oneworld member so re-booking would’ve been logical), but the agent didn’t even bother to check if they had any seats available and just told us we’d have to wait 24 hours for the next flight with AA since they only re-book passengers to another airline if they can’t get you to your destination within 24 hours. While they did give us two hotel rooms for the night, they only provided one food voucher (12$ per person, which was absolutely ridiculous. In the end, I missed parts of my university exams and my father missed an important business meeting, both of which we would’ve been able to attend had we been re-booked to British Airways. Oh and while I’m at it: don’t expect to get your luggage before departing for the hotel. We asked to retrieve it and were told, we’d have to wait between 2-8 hours to get it delivered (keep in mind, it was 7pm), which meant we were stuck in the hotel (which thankfully provided some amenities) with just our carry-ons. It became apparent there is no communication between and knowledge of other departments with AA staff since the re-booking agent told us we‘d get our bags right away, while the guys at the baggage claim said the above. The baggage guys (also from AA) even said there was no communication between departments and certainly no mutual help. This experience and the treatment we received was quite literally the worst we’ve ever had with any airline (and we are frequent fliers), be it a US or other airline.

"Not Verified |  Lacking consistency. I'm often feeling lack of appreciation of business given. I fly every week with American Airlines for the last couple years and was excited to earn that status I have. Pretty disappointed so far. Initially I passed my frustrations off due to the pandemic, understanding the added stress the staff had to go through but I guess that became the new norm. My company gives us choice of preferred airline and the majority of my company flies Delta. It's been an ongoing joke difference of the level of perks, appreciation and treatment that Delta gives over American.

I'm often feeling lack of appreciation of business given. I fly every week with American Airlines for the last couple years and was excited to earn that status I have. Pretty disappointed so far. Initially I passed my frustrations off due to the pandemic, understanding the added stress the staff had to go through but I guess that became the new norm. My company gives us choice of preferred airline and the majority of my company flies Delta. It's been an ongoing joke difference of the level of perks, appreciation and treatment that Delta gives over American.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Firstly American flights are canceled and delayed and agents are not courteous and patient with customers. There are no explanations why flights canceled and the agents remarks they are tired and frustrated about it too. I begin my trip by arriving 3 hrs before my flight from ORD to ONT, to learnt at the checkin counter that my original flight is delayed and I will missed my connecting. At that time I had to beg the agent to look for another flight out from Chicago. However, after 40 mins or so, she got one through Phoenix. When I arrived Phoenix was further delay for 7 hrs before leaving at 11pm to ONT. My thoughts are the airline canceled flights then to combine passengers into one flight, but does not publish or shared with customers. They do not care how tired and harassed are the passengers that are going through this process. I had two important appointments that I missed during all this course of travel and none of the agents shows any concerns to the passengers that had to site for hours. The irony of all this, my checked bag was 50.05lbs and they asked me to open and remove something, so it get below 50lbs. Also, if you complained on an issue, they become very vindictive and further try to delay you from boarding American Airlines needs to improve on there schedule and retrain those agents that becomes complacent I am. Frequent traveler go AA and hope to continue, but they need to address and improve and stick to your reservation flights schedule.","Firstly American flights are canceled and delayed and agents are not courteous and patient with customers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a truly horrendous traveling experience with American Airlines on my return flight from Newark to DFW. My flight was scheduled for 6:30 pm, and I arrived at the airport at 4 pm to go through the tedious security check. Upon reaching the gate, I was informed that my flight was delayed by an hour. As time passed, the delay kept extending, and we were eventually told that we would only be boarding the plane at around 9:45 pm to 10 pm. After boarding and taxiing for half an hour, the pilot announced that they had exceeded their allowed hours, and we would have to go back to the terminal. It was incredibly frustrating to have to go through the entire boarding process only to be turned back due to an issue that should have been sorted out beforehand. Upon returning to the terminal, we were informed that the flight had been canceled, and we would have to wait until the next day to fly out at 11:15 am. The process of waiting in line at the AA counter to secure a hotel reservation for the night was a frustrating two-hour ordeal. When I finally arrived at the hotel, I was informed that they had not received any information about my reservation. Luckily, they had a room available, but it was an unnecessary inconvenience after an already stressful day. The next day, we arrived at the airport at 8 am, went through security again, and boarded the plane. However, after only half an hour, we were informed that there was a technical issue with the plane, and we had to disembark yet again. I was fed up with the constant delays and decided to book a flight with United while waiting in line for a refund. The whole ordeal cost me $850 for a one-way ticket for myself and my wife. Overall, this experience was a complete nightmare, and I have decided never to travel with American Airlines again. I will make sure to share my experience with anyone who asks for recommendations.","I had a truly horrendous traveling experience with American Airlines on my return flight from Newark to DFW.

"Not Verified |  Flying American airlines on March 12th and March 13th was the worst experience of my life! My flight was supposed to leave at 7 am on 3/12. My flight was then delayed to 2:43 pm, then to 4:05 pm then to 4:26 pm. I had a connecting flight to charlotte. I noticed that my connecting flight was within a ten minute time frame to depart upon me landing. I asked the gate attendant about it and she said the flight from Charleston is only 30 minutes so I should get there in time. Well the flight was 50 minutes and we landed in terminal A and my connecting flight was terminal C. Myself and others tried to get there and it was to late. The flight was closed and there was 7 minutes left before departure but they said they could not let us on. We had to go to the customer service counter to get another flight out of charlotte. I got another flight going to DFW that was to depart at 7:22 pm then it was delayed to 8:04 then again to 8:24.. we finally boarded and got ready to take off and then there was engine trouble, we sat on the tarmac for at least 2 hours before everything was fixed. I knew then that I would not make my connection flight in Dallas because of the delay in Charlotte. My connecting fight was to take off at 11:30. We got to Dallas at 1 am. American airlines got rid of the rest of the itinerary. Now I sit in the airport with no where to go, everything is closed. I finally called American airlines and was on hold for 2 hours. They got me on a flight at 10:55 am which at this point was 6 hours away. This flight was delayed by 40 minutes and I finally got home at 2pm PST. After trying to get home since 7 am on 3/12 I finally made it home on 3/13 at 2pm. I have since emailed a complaint for a refund or some sort of compensation for my troubles and missing work on Monday.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a connecting flight where they closed the gate on us right as we rushed there. They didn't even realize we were on a connection when they looked at our boarding passes and said ""well you have to get here with enough time so that you don't miss your flight"". Completely smug attitude with no sense or urgency. We explained that we had a connection and the flight still had 15-20 mins until it's scheduled departure time and how did they not see that the two missing passengers were from a connecting American Airlines flight that had just landed. It's like they've never dealt with a connecting flight before. I get if the flight is 30+ minutes late and you can't hold up another departing flight for that long but there was still PLENTY of time to spare. Horrible gate agent not doing the basics simply seeing where the two missing passengers were coming from. The manager came and said it would take too long to reopen the flights. I get when the gate is closed and all that final stuff but they closed it 20 minutes before the flight and should have known we were coming from a connection. A good airline would take notice of that and hold off for as long as possible. I've had this happen before with Southwest and they did the right thing. We argued with this guy for 20 minutes telling us how long it would take to reopen the flight blah blah while watching our plane still just sit there and not even back up yet. We would have been in our seats sitting down 10-15 minutes ago but all he would do is say ""sorry nothing we can do"" Ridiculous. Airline is run by lazy clowns, it's no wonder they had all that controversy during covid kicking families off planes for their 1 year old not having a mask on.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Missed flight by a couple of seconds. Won’t let us on. Rebooking line is about 8 groups of people but took 2 hours, yes 2 hours. Instead of a 6 hour flight now we have to waste 16 more hours flying to random places. Ok, at least the agent did help us rebook. Told us gate d14, boarding now. We went from the rebooking booth with is next to gate d37 to d14, when we arrived there were only a couple of people there, waiting for the same flight since an hour ago, and there is no agent around to be seen or signs or broadcasts. I checked the flight info board two gates away, it said d43 for our flight instead. So we had to run all the way back the direction we came from and almost missed the flight again. Planes are 737max, the awesome ones that have no screen. Since they have no screen the stewardess had to demo the safety instructions. I cannot recollect when I've seen that last. On our previous leg, we and a lot of other people were told that the overhead bins were full so we need to check in our bags. After the gate check in madness, when we boarded we noted a lot of empty spaces, so much so that on take off and landing you hear luggage moving to the front and back in the compartments due to the empty spaces. And of course, our brand new carry on luggage was damaged and beat up. Overall an extremely poorly managed airline. If not for the name American I would expect it to be out of business like yesterday.","Missed flight by a couple of seconds. Won’t let us on.

"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines has finally dropped to the one star category in my opinion, it is actually quite unbelievable how the quality of every aspect of American Airlines has dropped. All the staff from cabin crew to flight crew look disheveled and fed up, uniforms have gone out the window, the cabin crew wear whatever they want and generally they are disinterested. The food, covered many times on this forum goes from bad to worse and in most cases is in fact inedible, I am quite sure that it has been many years since anyone in AA actually tasted or reviewed the food. The seat on the flight in the Flagship Business was not functioning and remained in the upright position for the entire flight, the only available seat was 1A which I was told was reserved by the FAA and in fact turned out 5 hours into the flight was for the captain to have a nap for 2 hours before returning to the cockpit. This really sums up everything about AA, the crew are more important than the paying passengers and the passengers are merely a distraction while the staff wait for their pensions or redundancies. As far as I know, no other 'reputable' airline puts its staff in premium seats, they use cabin rest areas, this seat should have been given up to accommodate the paying passenger, who also happens to be an Advantage Platinum member, what does it say about an airline that makes a paying passenger sit upright for 8 hours and lets the captain use a seat for a 2 hours when there is a crew rest area on the 777-200 aircraft? I have flown AA many times and no matter what happens or what situation occurs I will never fly with AA again. On the take off from Miami all the window blinds remained down and nobody appeared to be bothered, with the 25 year old planes, the lack of maintenance and despite the disinterested crew and the terrible service AA will always have passengers that have to fly, but those with a choice with certainly not choose American Airlines. I wonder how long it will be before AA is actually a 1 Star airline on Skytrax, it has fallen steadily over the last few years and it would seem that Management are completely oblivious to the disgraceful state of the airline.","American Airlines has finally dropped to the one star category in my opinion, it is actually quite unbelievable how the quality of every aspect of American Airlines has dropped.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased my husband and myself Business Class tickets from Raleigh to Porto. I noticed after purchasing the tickets that I did not have seat assignments for all the flights. So I waited a few weeks and then checked back - still no seat assignments. I tried to get the assignments online and could not do it. So, I started calling the Airlines. I called both American Airlines (whom I purchased tickets from) and then also called Iberia (whom is a codeshare on part of the flights). American referred me back to Iberia and then Iberia then referred me back to American - both stating they couldn't help with seat assignments, which I found odd.

She then went on to say that they have problems with Iberia and can't get seats assigned. She said we should have seats and when we check in at the gate they would be assigned there somewhere on the plane. I even asked if American Agent could message Iberia and make sure we had seats on the planes. She said she could not do so, but thought we would have seats if the flights weren't sold out. I told here we have tickets and she said she could see we had tickets purchased in Business Class and that we should have seats on the various flights.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Fails on multiple accounts. Twenty minutes before boarding my first flight, I received notifications that my connecting flight was completely cancelled. No offer of explanation or reason and only the automated, ""We are working to resolve this"" statement. Only had available options for new flights, which were limited due to the fact that it was going to a very small airport with only one way in, therefore a known limited dependence on their airline. When I, myself, found another flight that would have gotten me to a nearby airport and presented to that gate in another terminal just as they were about to close, the representative at the gate denied my boarding, even though there was space, because, ""I did not have any visible interruptions on my record via the record locator"" because I had reflexively chosen the first available new flight option to have something  on the agenda. All that despite the multiple texts, emails, notification of the clear cancellation of my connecting arriving flight. 3After I was able to find an equivalent of this second alternative route with a pleasant LAX AA customer rep via United Airlines, both he and the United airlines rep reported that I still had my return flights. However, the next day when i was checking status of the flights, they no longer appeared, and I was no longer on those flights, I suspect due to the fact that I was never cancelled from my original flights and as I did not board those, it cancelled my returns. This was all discovered 6.5 hours prior to departure.  Even after I called and had those return flights rebooked under me, I had to ask the rep to check on the status, and only then did she relay that the outgoing first leg was already found to be delayed to arrive at my connecting airport 30-40 minutes after the connecting leg was supposed to takeoff, prompting to find ANOTHER alternative route, causing me to leave for home 5 hours earlier than expected for an already short trip. Because of all these changes, I have had the extra expense of finding a last minute rental car, as the alternative airport was 95 miles away, and the corresponding gas. Then I had to change the rental return last minute. Again, still no courtesy to explain why I was heavily inconvenienced at all in the first place. No offer to proactively help other than the automated, ""Here are alternative flights"". If I had not been proactive, I would have flown out of my original airport and gotten stuck at the layover for over 12 hrs, and arrived at my destination with less than 24hrs to spend. And THEN would have been forced to be delayed at my second layover, causing me to be late for work Monday morning. Will never fly with American again. Absolutely horrible experience and no remorse whatsoever. I have travelled on many airlines and am very accustomed to policies and procedures, but this was unacceptable. Thankfully I was travelling alone with one carry-on, due to the already short nature of the trip, but if I was going for work, or with my kids, or with a checked-in luggage, this would have been 10x more horrible.","Fails on multiple accounts.

Had really bad clear weather turbulence, boarding on violent for about 2 hours that the pilot struggled with and did his best. Then ran into a heavy storm on the east coast and had to circle around a few times over the ocean before being able to land at JFK, but the pilot kept us informed. Landed at JFK and made it quickly over to the gate to catch our flight to Buenos Aires. Took off in the pouring rain right back into the storm we just got out of and had a few more hours of turbulence before the flight settled down. Food and drink service was standard economy meals and snacks with multiple beverages runs made. Made it to Burenos Aires, cleared customs and baggage arrived promptly. Only positive things to say on this journey.","San Francisco to Buenos Aires via New York. Can't fault American Airlines, I seem to have good luck with them. All flights departed and arrived on time.

"Not Verified |  My flight experience per the route noted and on my return from Phoenix through Charlotte to Harrisburg were uneventful and pleasant. Using the American Airlines app with the early check-in was easy. Mobile boarding passes are the GOAT. The app also helped me find my way from gate to gate in the Charlotte airport with approximate walking time. In fear of hiccups, I made sure my carry-on had everything I needed in the event my luggage didn't make the trip. I put an air tag in my luggage just for my own peace of mind. But the app also enabled me to know that my luggage was on board, so when I went to the baggage claim, I knew it was coming out eventually. No stress. For my trip out, I planned a long layover in Charlotte but on the way back, I changed my original flight and the choices were limited. My layover was less than an hour in Charlotte and I was a little worried about making my connecting. I was flying back two days after the Super Bowl, so there's that too. Honestly, all my flights were early upon arrival and I had no issues whatsoever with luggage. The in-flight crew was very friendly and helpful. Seriously, no bad vibes from anyone at all. You know how it can be -- people are professional and helpful, but somewhat unfriendly. That certainly was not the case at American Airlines in my experience. Obviously, I can't speak to what the service would've been like had issues arisen. In the event my flight didn't make my connecting on time on the way home, I was prepared to re-book and find a place close to stay for the night. Like I said above, I fully expected there might be hiccups and tried to anticipate them to the best of my ability - and stay calm Getting upset, while sometimes unavoidable, only makes things worse. I will also add that I witnessed no negative encounters during any of my four flights or while at the airports. In a day and age where you're sort of at the mercy of what you hear/read internet or other news, and when that news tends to spotlight everything that's wrong with our world, I would not have been surprised to witness or hear people being rude to each other, to staff, or just in general. Traveling is tiring. Airplane seating is tight. People get frustrated. I am happy to report that my trips were filled with kindness and courtesy. The only negative (and maybe I was technologically challenged) was that I would've had to pay extra to use the wifi. The in-flight entertainment was easily accessible, with a lot of choices - so that was good. I will definitely fly American again. I felt welcomed, accommodated, and safe.","My flight experience per the route noted and on my return from Phoenix through Charlotte to Harrisburg were uneventful and pleasant.

And my wife is in able to travel due to having a high fever. American Airlines refused to give us any kind of credit and said that only those people with a positive Covid test will get sickness credits. Absolutely ridiculous.

"✅ Trip Verified | My Flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK was cancelled only 4 hours before my flight while I was on my way to the airport already. At the airport no one was able to tell me what was the reason for the cancellation. The weather at the time at the departure, transit and destination locations are all clear with no thunderstorm or even just rain. I noticed no other airlines had cancellations except American Airlines at that time. They gave me the replacement flight the next day from Miami instead. It seems to me that the reason for the arbitrary cancellation is simply there weren't that many passengers for this flight as I noticed at that time. That's compared to flight from Miami which was completely full. This is unprofessional and something that usually occurs in third world countries but not in USA. FAA should fine any airline that cancelled flights for no reason whatsoever and especially just to fill up seats in an otherwise less than full airplane and especially when they operate in US.

"Not Verified |  I had two connecting flights booked for my trip home. On the first flight, they were asking people to switch to a later flight for monetary compensation, so I offered. They added me to the next flight as a “backup” but ended up not needing me to switch, but they never took me off that new flight. I get on this first flight with no issues, but when I don’t show up for the second one (that shouldn’t have been booked at this point) they flag it as a “no-show” and cancel all upcoming flights on that trip — my second flight home that night AND my two flights back later that week. At this point I had no idea this was happening because my boarding pass was still visible on the app for all my flights. At the second airport, I had my boarding pass in the app readily available, walked up to the gate to scan it, and the gate agent stated that my ticket was cancelled and my seat had already been given to someone else. He claimed that I cancelled it myself in the app, which I 100% did not do and never received an email, text, notification, etc that my ticket was cancelled. Luckily they were able to squeeze me on the last flight of the night, but I was panicking thinking I was gonna have to spend the night in a strange city I’ve never been to before! The gate agents were not very empathetic to my situation. I spoke with the representative on the help line who was unable to help me, so I filed a complaint with corporate who also blamed the entire situation on me and was no help. This entire experience left a very bad taste in my mouth and I would warn anyone booking with this airline!","I had two connecting flights booked for my trip home.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Service was terrible. We were 6 fully paid passengers with 2 infants. Four adults, 4 children ages 5, 3, 1 and 1. Bought AA tickets through the AA website roundtrip San Diego - Helsinki. We called about a week in advance and added the two infants to the 6 paid tickets itinerary. Agent said all was fine. Check in at SAN took about 2 hours at the counter while the agent tried to add the infants to our group. Paid for the infants and finally was told all was done, booked through the roundtrip. Tried to board at 10:00 pm the codeshare Finnair in NY JFK and was told the infants had no tickets. Finnair said that AA didn't transfer to infants' tickets to Finnair. Went to AA desk and they tried to do the transfer but couldn't before the flight left. We waited at the AA desk from 10:00 PM to 1:30 AM while they tried to do this transfer. We had four young children in a very uncomfortable situation during this wait. About 11:00 PM I asked the agent to just process the hotel stay, since that was obviously necessary, so we could get the children to sleep. The agent was surly, and insisted that she finish the ticket transfer process first. This was not finished until 1:30 AM, and we were very distressed and unhappy. To make matters worse the local AA manager insisted it was Finnair's problem while the AA agent who finally got it transferred acknowledged it to be AA's fault. Every AA agent we interacted with was rude and unhelpful for our situation. On our return out of Helsinki only one of the infants' tickets was in the system, and it took hours and calls to AA tech support while we waited at the Finnair checkin counter to get this fixed. Luckily we didn't miss the flight because we got to the airport at 4:30 AM, 3 hours before the flight. When I buy a codeshare ticket through AA I expect them to be responsible for their process through the codeshare. Finnair told us this was a frequent situation in dealing with AA. I don't know why I or anybody for whom I buy tickets for should ever fly AA again.","Service was terrible. We were 6 fully paid passengers with 2 infants. Four adults, 4 children ages 5, 3, 1 and 1.

"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been a decade or so since I've flown AA. The trip out, which I am not reviewing here, added 3 hours to our travel time which was a guessing game of, ""will we or won't we"". The trip back was the doozy. We had a flight scheduled for 3 months. All locked up with seats selected and all. On the day of our travel home from Eagle, CO airport, we received a notice via the AA app that the flight was delayed and that we MUST choose another connecting flight because we'd miss our Chicago O Hare connection. So we do and the flight that was chosen via the app actually took us to DC instead of MD. We called to correct this item and that transfer only took 26 minutes on the phone. At this time, we were on the hour long bus ride to the airport to catch our now confirmed 240pm flight. As SOON as we got that confirmation, we checked the app immediately and there was another delay 2:40 to 4:02pm We figured, ""okay, things happen but let's make the most of it"". We waited at the Eagle airport for 5 hours before the notifications started flying. Delayed again to 5pm. Again, looking like we'd miss our connecting flight again but then reassured by the staff at the check in desk that we'd be fine. I brought up that there seemed to be confusion with the app and the information that they had. Again, reassured that we'd be fine. The time finally rolled around to board and this same attendant came running up to us to apologize about the information she shared a half hour ago. We would in fact, likely not make our connecting flight. So, we took this flight anyway. Got to the airport and the plane taxied for a half hour to get to our terminal (this included wait time for a spot to open?). We asked the check in attendant if we could get to the next gate before they left, he said we could. He didn't offer to radio ahead to hold the door for 5 minutes or anything. We ran. And I mean, almost had a heart attack ran to go the 20 gates to make the flight. They were pulling away as we showed up. The first time I've ever seen a plane pull away from the concourse on time ironically. The desk attendant of course couldn't help us because all flights out of Texas apparently stop at 730pm? I expressed my displeasure with the fact that everyone would tell us there were delays, rarely did anyone know what system was disclosing the delays to customers and that no one could tell us why there were so many delays. We were told ,""weather"". Not where the weather was bad but that there was ""weather"". Eagle was 28 degrees with blue skies and jets were taking off left and right. Texas was 65 degrees and Maryland was in the teens with no snow or ice. We were offered the very last flight out of Dallas but it would get us in to DC at 2am. We reluctantly accepted with confirmation of a ride from one of our good friends. Otherwise, we were stuck in a motel and another connecting flight through Charlotte to BWI. The airlines are crumbling but this was just horrendous. We were not the only ones affected this day by AA. Nor will we be the last.","It's been a decade or so since I've flown AA.

There is a shuttle, until 11 pm, but based on that info and information from another airport information clerk who said no hotel shuttle as well, I had to walk from terminal F to terminal B, not a short distance for a senior citizen and one who had already walked and shuttled several directions and terminals. For the most part, no one who worked in the airport or for AA seemed to care one iota! Also, I had paid for Priority boarding, but did not get this, flight was re-booked. Then, when arrived in Manchester, NH, no one in baggage office to get my bag from night before, and AA desk personnel told me to walk back and stand by the door, he'd be back soon. No one at AA in Manchester, NH seemed to care, either. Terrible experience overall!",2024-05-21,JFK-LHR,Leisure,American Airlines,Staff Service,-0.057894736842105256
"Not Verified | We flew to Miami and then Panama on American Airlines, I usually travel with United and have travel status with United. I remembered why I do not like flying with American. The staff was very unfriendly and unprofessional at the airports in Savannah and Miami on the return. The flight in Savannah was delayed two hours, no fault of anyone there but the girl at the counter sat around on her phone and she could have had people put tags on their bags because it was a full small plane and instead she caused us to sit for an extra 45 min and the airline stewardess were annoyed at her and yelling at her and they all were arguing. The stewardess were absolutely right, she caused us to just barely make out flight to Panama which was the only one that day but unfortunately our bags did not make it. SO, we ended up stuck in Panama without any bags on Christmas eve. No clothes or toiletries and we could not leave to portobello like our travel plans called for. The next day, Christmas, I spent hours at the airport trying to find someone from AA to get me my bags that had come in on the flight. Literally one person working for the entire airlines. Unless it's the only airline going there, I will never fly with them again.","We flew to Miami and then Panama on American Airlines, I usually travel with United and have travel status with United.

When I arrived at the Dallas airport, I reported the incident to an AA CSR, and she printed out several forms for me to fill out and mail in. I tried to make a claim online, but the site was not user friendly and continue to ask for a claim number. I would recommend to anyone who has problems with missing or damage items in your luggage to file a claim within 24 hours, if not you may receive a generic letter asking you to file a claim with your travel insurance and that American Airlines will look forward to you flying with them again.","The day before Thanksgiving, my grandson and I flew on American Airlines from Dallas, TX to Memphis, TN.

"Not Verified | Overall, four very disappointing flights with American Airlines in First Class. We few MIA -LAX-HNL-LAX-MIA. All were disappointing. Our biggest complaint were the so called First Class seats, frankly I have sat in better and more comfortable seats on an economy flight in Asia. Little legroom, no footrest and a very minimal recline. I am 6' 4 ' and it was impossible to get comfortable and certainly not possible to sleep. We were not allowed to use any lounge despite being in First Class for all legs unless we paid $59.00 for a day pass. The lounges were nothing special and in LAX the ground personnel took pleasure in telling us that the showers were not available to passengers. Boarding all airports was a joke. When the flights are called all passengers surge forward and all the ground staff do is just accept the boarding passes, no control or finesse whatsoever. On board meals were so, so. Nothing exciting and certainly not served with any enthusiasm or pleasure. Only one round of drinks offered on a five hour flight, fortunately we had taken our own water on board. I would urge any future potential American passenger to be very careful and check what type of aircraft will be used, the A321 is a nice aircraft but the AA First Class cabin should be avoided, its just not worth the money. We will not fly American again. Overall an awful experience.","Overall, four very disappointing flights with American Airlines in First Class. We few MIA -LAX-HNL-LAX-MIA. All were disappointing.

I was forced out of my chair because they said my battery was not safe to fly. I was told I might not be allowed to board if I did not remove the battery from my chair. When I responded that I’ve never had to remove it (hence, the fact that it’s affixed to the frame with screws & the cord is all wrapped around the frame with flex ties), that I was not physically capable of removing along with the lack of knowledge to comply with their request. A man said “if you keep refusing to cooperate, we are going to deny you boarding”. I was not refusing, I simply was telling the truth & pointing out the obvious. I was never disrespectful to any staff. I am a disabled veteran diagnosed with PTSD/MST & chronic pain from an injury to my knees while serving in support of Desert Storm. I also have allergies & asthma. Asthma that is usually triggered by animals, flowers or pollen in the air. After I was allowed to board, I saw 7 cats & dogs pass by me. My eyes were already burning just from that. So I inquired what my rights were regarding those animals & my allergies because I could tell it was going to be an issue. After 14 days on a ship, all we wanted to do was go home & I had done a miraculous job of orchestrating everything so there would be no hold up anywhere. An AA employee got down face level with me & whispered in my ear that if I kept pursuing the allergy thing & insisting that I might need aid (ie oxygen) if I have an asthma attack from the animals & my rescue inhaler does not do the trick, that they will remove me from the flight. She said I suggest you take another mask from them & put it over your mask, turn your air vent on & or you won’t be flying. AA turned a 9 hour day into 27 hours, rebooked me to be stuck overnight in an airport, taking a whole other day to get to my destination & offered me no accommodation, reimbursement for or even a food voucher. Other people on the flight got vouchers but not me. I checked in with 3 bags & I’m 4 days after check in to the original nightmare flight & I’m still missing a bag with all of our brand new clothes in it.  Can’t get anybody on the phone to tell me where it is or when it might be here.  I do not recommend flying this airline.","I purchased my own $3000 battery powered wheelchair so I don’t have to use the airlines (& other places) wheelchairs.

"Not Verified |  We booked our flight 17 weeks prior to our vacation in Curaçao (lay over in Miami). The flight on American Airlines had a 6am departure. It was later changed to 7:05am … which gave us a 87 minute window to get to our flight to next flight at gate D40. We did not depart from ORD until 7:56. There was no explanation except that the food truck was unloading their goods. We arrived at gate D4 with less than twenty five minutes to make our gate. We were at back of the plane full of passengers. An announcement was made by flight stewards that those not pressed to make a connection should allow those that did have a connection be given deplaning priority. That was the last of any help by the apathetic airline staff. They just stood around making small talk. First, there was no weather related issue to delay departure. Plane was not arriving from anywhere else. We were sited almost at the very rear of the plane when itinerary was clear that we had a connection gate a distance away. My wife and I ran (even with a recent need replacement for my 76 year old knee). The airline staff was rude, apathetic, and lazy. There was little assistance. It was like “ we have your money, you are on your own). The return flight was as bad with the agent giving us the wrong boarding passes, causing immigration to detain us. Then our arrival at Miami-Dade was chaos. With immigration, baggage exchange, two sky trains and a mile and a half travel, we just made our flight. One, I will avoid AA. Two, I will avoid Miami Dade airport. Three, there appears to be a real lack of any customer service or consideration by American Airlines.","We booked our flight 17 weeks prior to our vacation in Curaçao (lay over in Miami).

The onboard crew was very polite and friendly and the ground staff was wonderful during this five hour delay. As we entered the plane they apologized to each individual passenger, and even issued everyone who asked a meal voucher. Once up in the air, the Captain apologized to everyone onboard over the PA system and even got us to Philadelphia ahead of the protected time of arrival. As someone who is constantly flying, the way American Airlines handled this entire delay was fantastic, I don’t understand what all that negative complaining is about.

The absolute worst fight experience I have ever had. The first and last time I will fly American, and I will tell all who will listen to stay away as well. Their pathetic offering of a food voucher included $12 a person and did not include my child. $48 dollars to feed a family of 5 for their own incompetence. Absolutely pathetic from start to finish.

"Not Verified |  Had a horrible experience with the ground airline staff from this airline. She requested us riding the coach to check in our hand carry bags claiming that the overhead cabins were full which we totally understand. We had 2 of our hand carries checked in, and one of us did not have any hand carry. But that woman insisted and just tagged the bag that we wanted to take in with us, I believe that if every passenger is entitled to 1 hand carry it shouldn't be a problem. My problem is when we went inside the plane there were open spaces in the luggage cabin, I say this because I was one of the last people to get inside and the cabins are still open, and some people behind me were able to bring in theirs. At the end of the flight again some people have big bags, so where is the fairness when they claim to give the best service to the public.","Had a horrible experience with the ground airline staff from this airline.

✅ Trip Verified |  I was treated so poorly yesterday by the manager of American Airlines that I will never be returning as a customer. I frequently fly with my Bichon Frise and I was told he was not allowed to go on the flight. The Manager took pleasure in telling me that. She smiled and laughed while I teared up. I was trying to see my family for the holidays. It was a month long trip. Hiring people who find pleasure in others pain is a terrible business plan for management. I have been working in Customer service for over 20 years and I understand that sometime you have to fake being nice. This manager did not fake being nice and smiled and laughed at the situation. I was shocked and so sad. Telling my mom I couldn't come home for Christmas was the saddest phone call I have had since her mother passed away. I will never fly AA and continue to fly Southwest since they have never given me issues with flying and their flights are reasonably priced compared to AA.

I checked in and paid my baggage fees online the day before my flight to save time. The morning of my flight there was a snowstorm. Several passengers were late in checking in due to traffic from the storm. American Refused to take our checked luggage saying we had missed the cut off for checking bags. I missed it by 15 min. I had to leave my luggage behind with family members and get on my flight. Other passengers who checked in after me brought their luggage into the plane with them. They were told their bags were too big and would need to be valet checked. So because I listened to the ticket agent and followed what she told me, I had to leave my bag behind and have it shipped to me for $50. I should have ignored her and just proceeded to the plane with my bag and had it valet checked. Also I was at Durango airport not Dallas Fort Worth. They had plenty of time to get our bags on that flight. Now I’ve requested a refund for the $30 checked baggage fee because American refused to take my checked bags. Of course my refund was denied. In the end I’ve learned an expensive lesson. Do not pay baggage fees until you hand American Airlines your bags. I paid for a service through American Airlines that I did not receive.

"Not Verified |  I had a very traumatic experience trying to come home from Europe with my service dog to make my mother’s funeral. Even though I was assured it was on all my flights it wasn’t. This time I wanted to be sure to avoid such unpleasantness. I went to the airport personally serval times and even purchased my ticket at the counter (very expensive) I even upgraded to first class! Each time I asked about traveling with my service dog I received contradicting information. When I called I would reach someone who barely spoke English with back ground noise that made the call incomprehensible. Finally I found a professional at the end of the phone and she helped me upload all my documents three to be precise in a way that the ”System” would accept them. She assured me all my paperwork was complete and I was confirmed on both of my flight to Cancun and gave me a record locator number. When I checked in at Louisville all went smoothly when I reached Charlotte the agent attending the flight told me no service dog was confirmed on the flight and I would have to find the service desk and deal with the problem. I had also requested wheel chair assistance (which never came). I was forced to stand for over thirty minutes while an extremely unsympathetic supervisor waited on hold to get the authorization I had already spent weeks getting. I was told that they would put me on a latter flight which meant I would arrive in a foreign country as a woman alone and try to speak Spanish, rent a car and find my way to my lodging! I became nervous and was told I could not board the aircraft because I could not obey orders. Finally after I became to upset and confused I left important documents I needed for my service dog to enter Mexico on the counter. After being extremely traumatized I was told I “Could” board the plan. A fully armed police man stood at the gate while Kiki and I were still waiting for clearance in the “computer”. At last I boarded but in my traumatized state I left the documents behind. When I arrived in Mexico I realized they were gone. The Mexican claims department told me they would try to get them put on the next flight and deliver them with my “lost” baggage. I delayed the delivery of my lost bag to await the arrival of my documents. The next day I was told that the supervisor refused to accommodate my request and the documents could only be sent to a USA address. Also when I finally received my bag a valuable item was missing. I think I can get this kind of treatment from one of the other cheaper airlines.

"Not Verified |  Avoid this airline at all costs!! Their customer service is terrible down the line, and their policies on their refunds are atrocious.

We were then forced to pay out of pocket, and are now fighting to get our money back that we had to pay for this hotel. not only did we had to pay for the hotel, but there was a hidden fee of $170 added to my account for some hotel booking service that I was unaware of.

"Not Verified |  My flight to Bogota was fine. Uneventful. My return date was November 1st. I had an early flight from Cartegena to Bogota. This was with another airline. I had about an hour after arrival in Bogota to go from national to international area. Due to this being an international flight I could not get an e-ticket or do any pre-boarding. I arrived at the AA counter and was the only person in line. There was one agent. He ignored me and walked away. Unfortunately I do not speak Spanish. While standing at the AA counter I received notification my flight was boarding. I went to Immigration to ask for assistance. I was walked from one end of the airport to the other. Finally, I was told where there would be AA agents to assist me. An agent by the name of Verantina spoke with my son and daughter-in-law. I could see the agent getting frustrated and actually throwing her pen down but did not know what was being said. She handed me my phone back with a forced smile. I asked my son what was going on and he said she will not help you. He was told it isn't American Airlines' fault that I missed my flight. I am not trying to blame AA for my missed flight, I needed assistance in getting home! I never in my life experienced an airline whose agents did not try at all to assist their customers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville ... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport). We could have rented a car and driven to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse. Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany. At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that's where I'm positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I'm confident we will not have an issue as it's the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I'm standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me no it's too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I'm told, ""I don't care what they let you do on that flight you're not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can't bring it neither are you!"". OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I'll be right back then to which I'm getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that's not my problem I didn't tell him could go ahead and board. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag.

Apparently, humans are so compartmentalized that opening a door that is a few hundred feet away, requires another department and possibly a whole new committee meeting.",2025-05-22,JFK-LHR,Leisure,None,Baggage,-0.011688311688311689

✅ Trip Verified |  The worst experience flying ever. Got in from Austin with 2.5 hours to spare. Told Gate was B10. Confirmed on board. Sat there for over an hour only to find out gate was changed to B8. Never heard 1 announcement until gate was closing. Had to go to customer service who put me on a flight that left in 5 hours. Asked what gate. I was told (as was another woman who missed the same flight) A2. After sitting there for awhile was told our gate was B6. Sitting here now. Hopefully I get him sometime this week. ,The worst experience flying ever. Got in from Austin with 2.5 hours to spare. Told Gate was B10. Confirmed on board.

However, I was also charged $2250.00 for this plane ticket. I talked with an agent when I returned for my refund and was told my plane ticket was non changeable and non refundable. She said it was use it or lose it. But apparently, it was ok for American Airlines to change my flight. I received a survey from American Airlines which I gave zeros on every level. I also wrote why and what my experience was. I also stated that I still want my refund and I would give them a few days to get back to me. They did not.

"✅ Trip Verified | I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with American Airlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in they sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight. I am making this review to make anyone aware that has a minor child to possibly find another airline because this is the most unacceptable thing that I have ever had to deal with. I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable.

"✅ Trip Verified |  After 55 years of flying, as my father before me, to every major city in the US and to many countries abroad with over 100 flights annually, I can truely say I have had it with civil aviation. I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it. Secondly, How can a passenger expect they are being told the truth when you are told your aircraft "" has been taken out of service"" by maintenance only to reboard the same aircraft an hour later. I have my suspicions about that sequence of events but to long to go on in this forum. In the end the FAs saved us for they extended their duty hours to get us to XNA, otherwise we were screwed. Every passenger should be grateful to them as I was, even being 7 hours late. I read these comments about AA, it is shameful that a once premier domestic carrier and brand is now rated as a 2 star carrier. Its shameful that AA management does not care one ounce for their staff nor the passengers but only for the stock price of the shareholder. I don't begrudge that but I want reliable service week in and week out when I travel on business and not the ongoing maintenance and operational stupidity that happens almost weekly. The new loyalty program is joke and only rewards those committed to a CC not the AA brand. So when booking AA, roll the dice and take your chances. I would hate to stake my vacation, honeymoon or cruise based on their service level. I doubt you are much better off with SW, Jet Blue, Alaska or United. Maybe Delta is the best bet in todays environment but with their 15,000 pilots threatening strike action I doubt they can be depended on either. Good Luck out there because civil aviation is no longer civil.","After 55 years of flying, as my father before me, to every major city in the US and to many countries abroad with over 100 flights annually, I can truely say I have had it with civil aviation. I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Return flight to LAX. Flight out AA 265 wonderful, multiple choice meal, drinks, IFE functioning. Return AA 266 provided the worst culinary slop ever seen. IFE not working entire 5 1/2 hr flight. Flight attendants fantastic, mostly being apologetic for food service and lack of IFE. Business class, had only one fixed menu consisting of: no appetizer, an entree of beans and quinoa - navy beans, kidney beans, fava beans. For the medical audience, fava beans can induce a hemolytic blood crisis in patients with an enzyme deficiency. To not offer any choice definitely put passengers at risk. Grapes and processed cheese. Processed cheese! Luscious dessert - Oreos in a foil packet. There was at least a choice of two different crackers! I've attached a photo of the delectable repast. The flight attendants all advised writing letters to AA at aa.com, as this was not the first time the Lihue-LAX flight was shortchanged in quality. The letter was subsequently sent on the aa.com complaint window. As a frequent flyer, we normally would expect some amends in terms of a mileage bonus or something considering the fare paid, the lack of any IFE on a long haul flight, and the abysmal meal served.

They wanted to give me a money compensation but I didn't care about money compensation because it was a business flight so the company who I work for was paying, I missed the diner kickoff of an intern technician competition it's priceless. So I was stuck in CLT, the sweet onboarding agent found me a flight on the next morning but the new American Airlines supervisor didn't want to give me an hotel compensation for the night because I was supposedly not there when they call me for boarding ... but I was there 30 min before boarding. The boarding agent was arguing with him to make him understood but he didn't want to understand, unacceptable! October 21th 2022, IND to MTL, I had a connection to PHL. During the night I received an email, the flight was cancelled and they give me another flight 5 hours late in the day. New connection CLT, okay fine I go to the airport, the new flight is delayed about 30min then 45, 60, 75, 120 min. Enough delayed to miss my connection to CLT. Unacceptable!

The flight attendant worked hard, almost solo to serve, clean up, etc.. all with a genuine smile. The seats were comfy. My negatives are no screens and no Wi-Fi.

"Not Verified |  I am from the United States but teach in Thailand. Last Christmas, I was back in the United States visiting family and friends. This was when COVID was absolutely rampant in the U.S. and ended up getting COVID while there and was very, very sick from it. At that time, to get into Thailand, you needed a negative PCR COVID test, which I didn’t have, for my original flight to get back to Thailand. I ended up having to change my flight twice because of all of this and missed more than a week of school because of it. It was extremely stressful, especially while being so, so sick from COVID like I was. The customer service I received when I needed to rebook my flight multiple times was phenomenal. That was all such a stressful situation, and dealing with American to rebook my flight could’ve been one more area of stress, but it wasn’t. And I was so, so thankful. I called later than I was supposed to one of the times because I was driving to the airport to see if maybe I would get my COVID test back in time while driving to the airport to make my flight. I didn’t get the test back in time but didn’t call right away to change my flight because I had a pounding headache that was turning into a migraine and was extremely exhausted. When I called a few hours later, the woman I spoke to was incredibly helpful and understanding and still allowed me to rebook my flight without having to pay for a new one. She didn’t give me a hard time or make me wait a long time. It’s almost a year later, and I still remember her kindness and am still so thankful for her and how she helped me in the midst of a really stressful, really hard situation. I felt like she really valued customers as people and understood how stressful air travel was at that time; she wasn’t just going by policies. She may have technically been “breaking the policy,” but she made me want to be a loyal customer to American. With all of my flights since, when American has been an option, I’ve chosen American almost every time. She made me feel valued and seen as a person. So if anyone from American reads these reviews, I want you to know showing understanding and care to your customers, like this woman did to me, is how you gain loyal customers. Work to keep your employees like her, and hire more like her!","I am from the United States but teach in Thailand. Last Christmas, I was back in the United States visiting family and friends.

"✅ Trip Verified | As a twelve year military veteran, I’ve spent a significant amount of time on flights all over the world. In that time, I’ve never felt the need to write a bad review until American Airlines. Prior to the start of the trip, we had to rebook multiple times and reschedule plans due to the airlines canceling flights and expecting us to deal with their total lack of organization via email and numerous phone calls. During our first flight home, they canceled our connecting flight three separate times. They ultimately rescheduled us for a flight that departs 25 hours later. Bear in mind, we had originally paid extra to get an early flight home and now we’re an entire day late. We spent 30 minutes attempting to locate any American Airline employees to help in the airport. We finally located the “Admirals Club” (a club to supposedly help American Airlines guests) and asked for assistance switching the destination to a closer airport so we could rent a car with our own money and the guy refused to help us because we weren’t card members. Not only did he refuse to help us, but he proceeded to mock our circumstances and went as far as having the audacity to ask if we wanted to sign up for an American Airlines credit card because he would then, and only then, be able to assist us. If you want to pay thousands of dollars to be treated as if you don’t matter, American Airlines is the place for you. I’m going to happily spend the next 25 hours on every travel review website explaining just how our experience was, to hopefully advise other travelers to book elsewhere and help them avoid enduring this horrific experience.

"✅ Trip Verified |  What a joke American Airlines has become. Don't bother paying for a First class ticket because the only thing it gets you is a bigger seat. The service is such a disappointment. I traveled from RDU to CLT for the first part of my trip and during the flight at NO time did the two lead flight attendants offer anything to the first class cabin. Instead they sat up front the whole flight and chatted. They also brought full bottles of water to airline personnel that were traveling in the coach section who were non-reviving and heading home. Then they had the gall to walk through the cabin and ask for garbage because they would be to lazy to clean the plane at the end of the trip.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased tickets through Priceline. I was flying from Albuquerque to Spokane and had a layover in Phoenix. For the carry on they don’t let you use duffle bags. They don’t tell you that on the website. The flight was fairly short so they didn’t offer beverages but they did provide beverages upon request. I was requesting water and coffee so I can’t speak on that plane’s beverage selection, I remember seeing someone requesting Trulys. The second flight was about 2hrs and they were pretty consistent about offering snacks and beverages. They had a nice selection of beverages for being a plane. The only thing that cost money was the adult beverages. I will admit when it comes to beverage selection my expectations aren’t high for planes, coffee and water. They had coffee, water, a couple sodas, and adult beverages. Both planes were comfortable for being planes mind you I’m a ~190lbs woman with medium build.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a couple of major issues with AA after today’s flights. Firstly, carry on. My assigned grouping prevented me from boarding until 90% of passengers were already on the plane. When I could finally board, AA staff told that there was no space in the cabin for any more carry on items and that my single item (which met their carry on requirements) would have to be checked in. I replied that this was the first leg of a long journey to Australia and I needed access to my carry on. They literally said there was nothing they could do about that and that I would be bumped from the flight if I refused to check it in. They also said the door was closing soon so I had to decide immediately. I feel that this created an element of duress that was at a minimum unethical. I also think that their attitude to customers is appalling considering that these situation are 100% AA’s fault - their carry on requirements don’t align with the capacity of their own aircraft. When I finally received my suitcase back from them in Sydney, I found that they had somehow completely destroyed it (see attached photo). Secondly, the flight took off from DC at 5:15pm and landed in LA at 11pm (DC time). Who wouldn’t want to eat dinner at some point during these hours? Nevertheless, the only food they offered was a small packet of either cookies (for other Australians, this translates to “2 small biscuits) or pretzels. I couldn’t even pay them for real food - they just had nothing. I wouldn’t treat a dog like AA treats their customers.","I have a couple of major issues with AA after today’s flights.

"✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I were on flight AA1400 out of Miami today. We were attempting to get to our honeymoon destination in Jamaica. We boarded the flight around 12:10 PM with an expected take off at 12:56 PM. There was light rain that turned into thunderstorms for the first hour of us waiting to take off, delaying our flight. After the first hour it went back to light rain and we noticed several airplanes starting to take off on the runway. After waiting for another hour with minimal updates from the pilot, we were instructed to exit the aircraft. We did as we were told and went to the gate to wait for further instructions. We were informed after about 45 mins minutes that another pilot will be taking over and we were able to re-board the aircraft. The time at re-boarding was approximately 4:30. After another hour of waiting on the now second pilot to take us to our destination, the plane suddenly turned around on the ramp when we were very close to take-off. The plane was taken back to the terminal and all of us passengers were waiting to hear what the delay was this time. Unfortunately for us, there was little communication as to why we could not depart for our destination now 5 hours after our SCHEDULED departure time. I would like to say there was a “vague” explanation but I simply cannot. Even their pilot could not explain why he was not allowed to take us where we paid good money to be. It was at this time we were instructed to de-board the plane a SECOND time. After some talk amongst the flight crew and I suppose them communicating with their outside resources, they informed us of a THIRD pilot who would be boarding and be responsible for taking us to our destination. We FINALLY were able to depart at exactly 7:06PM. We had been on that plane for 7 hours today, just sitting and waiting and left in the dark. The flight crew kindly passed around cookies and one cup of water during our first delay around approximately 2:30. When asked to de-board there was no time for any passengers to stop and eat because we were trying to stay close to be informed on the situation only to re-board and wait an additional 3 hours. There were several small children on this flight as well. AA should be extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. It was unprofessional and cruel to leave us waiting and waste our time. My husband and I missed our first day at our expensive resort on our first day of our honeymoon. They left children and other passengers crying and hungry. Shame on them. I am not one to leave a bad review or even write an email to this extent (especially on my honeymoon) but given the situation it is much deserved. We tried on our honeymoon to call and get compensation and all we received were two $50 trip vouchers. We will NEVER fly AA again and neither should you. They lack care for their customers and accountability. They make it hard to file a complaint because I am sure they get too many.

"Not Verified | I have been a loyal American Airlines passenger since 2007. I flew with them for both business travel and my personal travel. In the last 2 years or so, their customer service has plummeted. My final straw was this morning when, to not fault of AA, I missed my flight by one minute because of a delay in the Queens Tunnel and the TSA baggage screening system breaking down and chaos happening. However, their gate agent, was one of the most unhelpful, rude and downright hateful persons I have ever met.

In the last 2 years or so, their customer service has plummeted. My final straw was this morning when, to not fault of AA, I missed my flight by one minute because of a delay in the Queens Tunnel and the TSA baggage screening system breaking down and chaos happening. However, their gate agent, was one of the most unhelpful, rude and downright hateful persons I have ever met.

"✅ Trip Verified | Ironically, American was EARLY on all of their flights, which alleviated a huge worry because of all the horror stories I've heard. The staff were friendly enough and basic services were offered (even on an extremely short flight), but my biggest issue was just how uncomfortable American's planes are. I'm 6'2"" and legroom ranged from acceptable, to downright awful. The seats themselves were simply some of the most uncomfortable I've ever experienced. I know the CRJ Series is not known for its comfort, but I've flown Delta's version, and it was far more comfortable than American's product. Also, the in-flight entertainment was clunky and straight-up didn't work on one of my flights. So in short, American got me where I needed to go on time, but the level of discomfort makes me hesitant to ever fly them again, especially if it is a longer flight.","Ironically, American was EARLY on all of their flights, which alleviated a huge worry because of all the horror stories I've heard.

"Not Verified | Just got back from Brazil. We flew American Airlines both ways. We had a total of 18 flights there and back. Everything was good until we went to board in Miami. Before we even boarded the gate attendant was talking to a drunk guy saying “now we aren’t going to have anymore problems with you are we?” And the gate attendant held out his hand for the drunk guy to shake it and the drunk guy wouldn’t shake it. They still let the drunk guy board the plane. As we are in position to take off the flight attendant came over the PA telling him to sit down we are taking off. He did sit down but they still had several problems with him. So when we get 1 hour out from Miami they turn the plane around, without saying anything to us until we are just outside Miami. Than when we landed we landed to hard and broke the landing gear. We hit HARD. Security came and got the drunk guy off the plane and we are told that we just had to refuel than we would take off. After 1/2 hour they said that we had to take our stuff and get off the plane. We waiting in the airport for over 2 hrs and there where mothers with multiple babies and they would not get those women their strollers so they had to hold their babies the whole time and there was 1 lady with 4 babies under 6 months. Than after 3 hours they tell us they are rescheduling our flight for the next day and we couldn’t get our luggage. So hopefully you packed some clothes in your carry on, which we had. We finally got in our hotel room at 3am. We had not had anything to eat since our last flight at like 4pm. We where starving and nothing was open. The next day we did take off around 1pm but we ended up missing a whole day of our trip. It messed up our hotel, rental car. We did file a complaint with AA. They offered My husband $50 total for our inconvenience. My husband emailed them back and said he was insulted. So they ended up giving us $175 per person of AA credit. Who says we will ever fly with them again. They can shove that. We will never and I repeat NEVER fly with them again. Plus the food was horrible. We will pay extra to fly another airline. If your going to fly you might want to pay extra for a different airline, it will be worth it. They should have never let the drunk guy on the flight, they knew he was trouble.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarded the planes. The first leg left on time, second a little delayed bit wound up around 10 minutes late. Crew was nice, but nothing memorable. Connected in Dallas, which seems to have smooth operations. The American App was not working so we had to get paper boarding passes. Come on, American, you're not Spirit! There was a power outlet, a type of USB port I believe was to plug your phone charger in, though I may be wrong, nonetheless, a port and outlet. The flight to CLE from DFW was on time which was nice. Unfortunately, though my first impression with American was in 2016 which was when A320 or A321 fleet had free entertainment and seatback screens which I hear they are in the process of removing in favor of streaming. Overall, both flights were nice and smooth, i'd take them over Spirit or Frontier any day if close in price, but i'll stick to United for now. Why? Because unlike American, United has reversed course and has decided to bring seatback entertainment with a personal tv on every seat on their whole fleet by 2025. If American continues their current path, they will be the only Legacy Carrier without seatback entertainment, and we will fly them only if they are significantly cheaper than their competitors, Delta and United, as they were when we booked this flight. One aspect i'd like to give American credit for, were the gate agents helping us out at CLE Airpot. As a United frequent flyer, the friendly agents reminded me of the good old days of Continental. Maybe we just got lucky, but the team at the check in counter was super nice, which was a pleasant surprise for a 5:45 AM flight!","Boarded the planes.

However, the cabin was severely understaffed and the cabin crew gave the impression of being annoyed at serving passengers. As with my JFK-ATH flight several weeks earlier the food served was close to inedible. On both flights AA offered a single appetizer of shrimp ... for anyone with allergies to shrimp or religious problems with said shrimp - tough luck. Further to meal service, drinks were served only once, no coffee or tea was ever offered. My Inflight entertainment did not function except for the first hour of the flight. Ninety minutes prior to landing we were told to expect severe turbulence for the next 45 minutes and thus no second meal service. There was not a single bit of turbulence nor a second meal service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  It’s not often that customers take the time and effort to review an airline.

Specifically, the customer service people Sharon and Kim in Wilmington NC on September 13 and Francisco on September 20 in West Palm Beach FL were, to a person, above and beyond in customer service. Sharon was wonderful at helping me sort out how to fly standby on an earlier flight. She helped Kim learn how to properly tag a checked bag when the traveler is on Standby. Instead of brushing me aside they were capable, calm, smiling, and gracious to me and to other travelers in line. Everything went smoothly as grace. So many other people greeted me with friendly smiles, good eye contact, patience and kindness (when I bugged them to ask if I’d made the cut to Standby seat). I was very impressed with the informative way in CLT that the gate agent for gently but firmly handling another inebriated male passenger and for juggling everyone with kindness, patience and aplomb. He informed us of the status of a fuel tank that needed to be topped off, and quickly and smoothly got us all boarded. No one works alone but I wanted to take the time to mention some of them by name. I’m again proud to fly “American”.","It’s not often that customers take the time and effort to review an airline.

"Not Verified |  I booked with American Airlines because I thought it was my best bet for safe and carefree travel. I could not have been more wrong. I was going on my honeymoon to Paris, Denmark and Italy and my entire trip was RUINED because American Airlines sent my bag to London, England instead of Paris, France.

"Not Verified |  I flew with American Airlines in late July. I was coming home (Minneapolis) from a wedding in Buffalo. I had a layover in Chicago. I checked my flight information before getting to the airport. I had already been delayed by two hours. These things happen. I understand that. I went to the Buffalo airport to talk about my options. They told me they could get me to Chicago that night, give me a hotel voucher then fly me to D.C. in the morning then back to Minneapolis. I agreed. I waited and kept getting delayed for the Chicago flight. As I was getting ready to board, I checked my email. American canceled my hotel voucher. I went to the desk to figure out what was going on. The guy tried his best but couldn’t get his computer to do what we needed. I was told to get on the flight and they would fix it in Chicago. When I landed at O’Hare, I was directed to the wrong gate for help three times. When I finally found the correct and open help desk, they had to pull a manager in to figure out the computer. They printed a new hotel voucher and told me I was set. I started walking towards the bus area and decided to call the hotel to make sure everything was good. The hotel had no record of me or my voucher. At this point, enough time had passed that if I left to try to get a hotel room on my own, I’d only have about an hour to try to sleep before getting up and trying to get back to the airport and get through security again. It wasn’t worth it. I had to stay in the airport all night until I could get on my first flight home. I have never been so disappointed while flying. I reached out to American Airlines to talk about my experience. They offered me a $125 voucher for another flight. I do not believe this was worth what I went through.

They also told me at that time that my flight back to BWI was delayed an hour and a half.

Following my dismissal from my conference for being unable to participate in my capacity the airline has still yet to send my luggage from Michigan. When I call to check on it I get the same indignant worker and there is no public ally available number to call in order to speak to someone about my issue. I would warn every customer who would check a bag with American against them. Their entire customer service is nonexistent and their employees are lackluster at best.,2023-09-29,DFW-ORD,Business,None,Baggage,0.08166666666666665
"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever. Started our trip on September 1 to a cancelled flight due to weather despite all other airlines flying into the same location. They rebooked us for the following day at 10 pm which would cause us to miss our connection in Lima to Cusco and cause a domino effect of missed booked tours etc, not to mention paid for hotels we didn't use and couldn't get reimbursed for. Eventually they did rebook our original flight on Alaska airlines which flew into Dallas on time. Our connection to Lima, however, was delayed. When we finally boarded, we sat on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for a copilot to show before the flight was pushed back 3 hours due to a curfew in Lima. We had to get off the plane and wait only to find out an hour later the flight was delayed until the following morning. There was a 200 person line at the customer service desk with 2 people working so we didn't even bother to try for a hotel or food voucher. The next morning flight got delayed an additional hour, but we finally made it to Lima. Our trip has now ended and we were supposed to be on a morning flight September 11 at 0800 to Dallas, but the flight was delayed 5 times inside of 15 minutes and eventually rescheduled 24 hours after the inital departure time this time due to mechanical issues. The story we got was the issue couldn't be fixed and they were bringing another plane in. Someone else we spoke to said there was a part they couldn't get and didn't know when it would arrive so who knows what the real answer is. No one on the phone for customer service could help us. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours and the best they could offer was a 30 hour travel time with 2 layovers in the opposite direction of where we needed to go only to arrive at the same time as we would if we waited until the next day (today). Just as we were about to leave for the airport this morning 5 texts came in stating the flight was delayed multiple different times. We called customer service who reassured us the flight was still happening and only delayed 20 mins. We got to the airport today and waited in line for 3 hours before receiving a text saying the flight had been canceled, but another scheduled flight to Dallas left on time. Staff directing people to the counter lines refused to give any information and were dismissive of people's concerns. When we got to the ticket counter, we were told all other flight options were already booked and the best they could do was give us a flight on a different carrier at 0100 tomorrow (40 hours after our originally scheduled flight) with an additional 8 hour layover at LAX. They finally booked us with a different carrier and hopefully we will make it home 2 days late. They told us before they weren't obligated to rebook us with any other carrier if the delay was 24 hours or less and that they don't have any other partner airlines they can book with, yet miraculously after the 24 hour mark they can and do book us with someone else. Half of our trip time has been spent traveling and we have lost wages at work, cost of extra hotels, and food. We had a family member with a medical emergency at the end of our trip and were unable to make it home in time before they passed away. Overall, the numerous excuses, delays, lack of willingness to accommodate customers, and inability to resolve issues in a timely manner make American Airlines one of the worst companies I've traveled with. I will never use them again.","Worst airline ever. Started our trip on September 1 to a cancelled flight due to weather despite all other airlines flying into the same location.

"Not Verified | Wichita to Indianapolis via Dallas. Airline communication was awful on the ground. They needed more staff to help handle everything properly. After flight got delayed several times resulting in a total of over 5 and a half hours, the crew moved everyone to a different gate that was about half a mile away and told everyone to wait for more info at 11:30 pm on a flight that was supposed to leave at 6:00 pm. After finally getting off the ground at 12:15 am, turbulence prevented drink service for half of the plane the rest of the 2+ hour flight. Plane seating was surprisingly cramped where I could not straighten my legs out, which is unfortunate because I was hoping I could at least get some rest on the plane. Most of the crew was actually friendly, which is sad because the overall situation seems to be a recurring symptom of a company that does not care about their workers or customers. It would have actually been two hours faster to drive from Wichita to Indianapolis.","Wichita to Indianapolis via Dallas. Airline communication was awful on the ground.

"Not Verified |  I booked my seat for these flights 5 months in advance. I was told I was being moved to coach for the long flight between Philadelphia and Seattle minutes before the flight was due to board. I was told I would not have my money returned to me and instead be provided with a voucher for future travel, which I don't need and wouldn't use. The reason provided was that the computer randomly selects four passengers to reseat in order to comply with weight distribution requirements. Upon further investigation, I discovered this was a lie and the airline had overbooked the aircraft. Although ultimately I did have my seat remain in first class, I was surrounded by people who had booked their first class seats within days of the flight. If the weight really needed to be leveled out in the plane, why weren't passengers being asked to move who had booked their travel more recently? I had booked these seats for medical reasons and as I explained that to the manager on duty at the gate in Philadelphia, it didn't seem to matter. The airline also charged me for first class for my flight from Albany to Philadelphia while I was stuffed into a regular seat at the front of the small plane that didn't differ from any of the other seats. Food is also not provided for short flights even though I was in first class. The flight from Philadelphia to Seattle was grounded for 2.5 hours before take off due to a sensor issue with the lavatory sensor. No compensation was offered to the passengers of the plane for this major inconvenience. On my return trip I had a layover at Chicago International and my connection flight got moved to the opposite side of the Airport at the last minute and my wheel chair assistance was late and I almost missed my connection flight back to Albany. Overall, I felt undervalued as a consumer of American Airlines. I do not feel they give proper treatment to passengers with disabilities.","I booked my seat for these flights 5 months in advance.

"Not Verified |  Allowed my son to travel (minor) with American Airlines on a domestic flight, after our stellar experience with Avianca out of the country. Oh my goodness was I wrong to do so. Arrived three hours early for his flight, when the recommendation was 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Long lines at baggage check got him within 1 hour of boarding time once he hit TSA. He was nervous it was now cutting it close and called me, so I told him to simply mention it to an employee and he was assured it would be ok. One of the TSA agents pulled him aside because he looked ""nervous"" and held him up until he had missed the flight. This isn't even the complaint. It's what happened next. I told him to go to the customer service desk and let me speak with the attendant - as he was a minor and couldn't make his own flight changes. The customer service rep told me he would not speak to me period, or allow me to be on the phone with my son while he made his arrangements and told my son to hang up on me. When my son called me back, they had re-routed him from coming home to Chicago, where all outgoing flights had been cancelled due to weather. I then attempted to contact American Airlines customer support to be sure he would not be sent somewhere he had no family, American Airlines told me if a minor is traveling (he's 17 and just cannot make airline ticket purchases without an adult not a child) they can do whatever they want with his destinations and whether or not they allow him a flight at all without parental consent. I hate this company's policy of directly not caring about the safety of its passengers.","Allowed my son to travel (minor) with American Airlines on a domestic flight, after our stellar experience with Avianca out of the country.

✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever. Delayed our flight to Charlotte by over an hour. Arrived in Charlotte with half of our flight with connections. Sprinted from our gate in terminal C to terminal E to get to our gate with 10 minutes prior to departure. No employee working at the gate. Over 5 people on our flight trying to catch a connection and not even someone at the gate 10 minutes prior. All of the people on our flight had to be issued an overnight stay voucher and a new flight. Talk about a waste of money and poor management on Americans behalf. They gave us a $12 meal voucher to “cover” breakfast and dinner. $12! Supervisor was incompetent and rude. Went to go get our luggage since we are being forced to stay overnight so my mom has her medication. Have been waiting over two hours for our bags to show up at customer service and missed our shuttle to the Comfort Inn they booked us at. Will absolutely never fly American again. Would rather drive from Phoenix to Cleveland than waste my money on them again.,Worst airline ever. Delayed our flight to Charlotte by over an hour.

Our flight from SDF to CLT was delayed because a plane swop which meant we would miss our connecting flight to MSY so we were moved to a flight from SDF to DFW. That flight was delayed about 2 1/2 hours due to weather. So as we are still waiting for the flight to board I get notification that the connecting flight in DFW to MSY is cancelled. The gate attendant says wait to get to DFW to sort out options. The gate attendants there will assist. We get off at DFW and go to a gate agent, he says go to B1 and they’ll help. But there’s no one at B1. Walked about a mile out of the way. Then we find the customer assistance area and wait in line for an hour only to be told they do nothing about weather, our flight is now at 8:30 am and there are a couple of hotels that have shuttles we can call them to get picked up. So we ask about getting our checked bag so we can take it to the hotel. They said it would take 6 hours to retrieve it so we have to go without it. So then we called all the hotels around the airport and all of them are full. So as I type this I’m stranded at DFW all night with no food (all the restaurants are closed), no luggage with my toothbrush in it and trying to get comfortable in these awful black seats. This is the worst travel experience I’ve had. I will never travel American Airlines again.","Absolutely horrible experience.

"✅ Trip Verified |  With a very heavy heart I decided to write this letter to share a long list of mistakes made by American Airlines in our last travel experience. We had no idea how much trouble we would be by trusting a company that seemed just about right at first glance. We are a group of 6 people (3 couples), average ages between 60-70, semi-retired (still working since social security income doesn´t even cover the average expenses) and self-employed. We had been planning this trip for several months since all of us had to close our schedules, save money and make it work according to our budgets. With all the inflation, recession it was already a struggle to make it work for us all. Everything started with our flight from Nashville to Miami being cancelled only 10 hours prior. We depended 100% on that flight to take an International flight to Samana (Dominican Republic) after only 4h layover. American Airlines is the only airline with that destination available and has only 1 flight/week to that location, so losing that flight would literally ruin the whole vacation. Our Resort was already reserved/paid for and could not be cancelled, so a no-show would cost us cancellation fee money as well. Immediately when we were notified that our flight was cancelled we called American Airlines Customer Service, it took nothing less than 1.5h to finally reach a representative and to be honest, she was not helpful at all. One more hour waiting and we finally could talk to a supervisor. She could not rebook us with American Airlines or any other partner so we decided to start searching flights from Atlanta (checking all other airlines) to Miami and ask the supervisor to change our coming back flight (final destination in Atlanta instead of Nashville so we could leave our car there and have a car to drive back home). Two hours later we could get our coming back flights changed with final destination in Atlanta but at that point there were no more flights available from Atlanta to Miami. Back to square one we decided to get us a flight straight to Punta Cana and forget the AA flight to Samana since would be impossible to get there in time even if we decided to drive. I found a flight from Atlanta to Punta Cana (5.5h drive from our Resort) and all of us could get a seat (we purchased from different websites all at once so nobody would be left behind). This flight cost each couple the average amount of $938. We loaded our Van and drove to Atlanta right away ($165.00 paid in gas). I also had to get a parking space for 7 days which cost us total $87.55. We finally flew to Punta Cana and got a 5.5h transfer to Samana, which also cost us the amount of $412.05. After this huge adventure we could make it there 24h later and it was the most stressful and frustrating hours in our lives. But the mistakes kept happening. When we got to El Catey Samana Airport, one of the check-in employees (still being trained) made a mistake: he forgot to print the tickets for the flight from Miami to Atlanta for 2 of us (Mr. Dannie Glover and Mrs. Hope Glover), later on in Miami the lady at the gate was extremely rude and unprofessional (her name is Valentina by the way). Flight to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours and she sent us to Gate D37 (Customer Service) just 5 min before boarding.

"Not Verified |  Used to love this Airline, 
 not so much anymore. Flight from MYR to ORD: passengers squeezed like sardines! I’m only 5,5” size 8/10 and I had next to no legroom, no space at all between passengers for elbows.  I can’t imagine if my son 6’ 200lbs off muscles would fit in those seats and that in the times of pandemic!! Pitch to recline virtually nonexistent. To top it off, the flight attendants went on a 5 minute Spiel of credit card selling, afterwards a prerecorded sales pitch, then before deplaning they came around with applications. Did I really pay to be forced to listen to infomercials I couldn’t mute? And in some variations that happened on all 6 flights! The last flight (CLT to MYR), the flight attendants seemed extremely bored/bothered - before deplaning they came with trash bags, not sure what for since there was no snack/drink offered. 
 As I got on my last flight, I overheard a flight attendant thanking the pilot for helping clear up a situation, a passenger to a different destination made it onto that flight… In ORD they took my carryon and said it would be there when I get off the plane, well it wasn’t, on top of that I was rushed off the bridge which meant I couldn’t get my luggage until “everybody” got off the plane and the gate agent went to retrieve it. This gate agent was very rude.  I barely made my connection and didn’t have a chance to pick up dinner until I got home. Lastly, the app is useless and only worked on 2 off 6 flights, couldn’t check in or get boarding passes on it! Couldn’t connect to in flight entertainment/wifi, not sure why, not that I could’ve used it since you need the old plug in headphones. Would’ve been nice to know at point of sale so I could’ve bought some of those outdated things. Other than that and the last 2 flight attendants/pilots/ground personnel was friendly and professional. The planes were dirty, trays/armrests, windows don’t seem to get cleaned between flights, Unfortunately this means, I am not looking forward to flying with them anytime soon again. The unpleasant experience left me wondering if I was flying one of those bare bone discount airlines.Very disappointing! Wish I could give zero stars for some…","Used to love this Airline,

Now it’s one of the worst flight companies out there. We travel 3-4 times a year if not more. We have had so many flights cancel over and over. They are no help. Flight was canceled at 11:30pm they said we need to call American Airlines and rebook a flight. I was on the phone for 3 hours. They rebooked us to another airport. Told us to Uber to another airport in NY then left us in the wrong airport in another country. Said you can take a train or fly to your last destination because we can’t get you there. All the extra cost for us to Uber from LaGuardia to JFK then we had to book a flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen (our cost). American Airlines should reimburse us for those extra expenses because our original fight took us to Copenhagen and then they canceled it and didn’t rebook us to the same destination.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my flight to Rome with them last month. I was supposed to fly to Dallas and from there to Rome. the morning of, 4 hours before my flight, i got a notification that my flight was delayed by 5 hours which would make me miss my connecting flight. That 5 hour delay turned into 8 hours. I called them and they offered, rebooking the same flight for the next day or canceling for a refund. I had to get to Rome as planned and so I couldn't rebook. I asked for a cancelation and the agent helped me submit the refund form online at the same time. That was a month ago. Since then they have told me to contact the other airline and the booking website. Saying I got the ticket through them.

"✅ Trip Verified |  For my husbands 65th I booked an Alaska cruise in Seattle, We live in Naples Fl. Everything went beautifully until our route home. I booked first class tickets for the entire journey. I did this as we are older and I have MS. Sitting in the rear seats for hours at a time is quite painful. Upon boarding our last flight, we were pulled out of the line and told that they had over sold the first class compartment. My husband and I had less miles then the new comer who wanted first class, we were told to move to the back of the plane. We were offered 2-$300 vouchers for two first class tickets. $600 dollars for 2 first class tickets! And the truth is, why would I trust flying with you again if you can just take my money and my seat and send me to the back? The flight attendant in first class came back to us and apologized and said that if there was any food left in First class - she would bring it back-she never showed. The attendant that was in our area, told us ""its just a few hours"" and rolled his eyes! I deliberately choose first class when I fly so as to be comfortable as my MS makes walking difficult, the more cramped I am in a small place the harder it is to get up and move. So first class allows me space and to get off first and not hold others up. In all fairness I am not using a cane at this time as I have my husbands arm, so they wouldn't have known outside of a slow gate and age that there was an issue. I have never been treated so disdainfully in my life, side note, the flight was not even close to being sold out","For my husbands 65th I booked an Alaska cruise in Seattle, We live in Naples Fl.

And the truth is, why would I trust flying with you again if you can just take my money and my seat and send me to the back? The flight attendant in first class came back to us and apologized and said that if there was any food left in First class - she would bring it back-she never showed. The attendant that was in our area, told us ""its just a few hours"" and rolled his eyes! I deliberately choose first class when I fly so as to be comfortable as my MS makes walking difficult, the more cramped I am in a small place the harder it is to get up and move. So first class allows me space and to get off first and not hold others up. In all fairness I am not using a cane at this time as I have my husbands arm, so they wouldn't have known outside of a slow gate and age that there was an issue. I have never been treated so disdainfully in my life, side note, the flight was not even close to being sold out",2025-09-25,DFW-ORD,Leisure,None,Staff Service,0.11167355371900828

"✅ Trip Verified |  Save yourself the massive headache and choose a different airline, even if it means paying slightly more. Constant delays and the staff openly lies to customers to de-escalate mounting frustrations. My first flight was from Dallas- Fort Worth International to Charlotte Douglas International. With a nearly full plane, we were stranded on the tarmac for over an hour because of a “last minute change” with the pilot, leaving us without a captain for the trip. The issue was eventually remedied by convincing an inbound pilot to fly our trip immediately following his own. This caused a significant number of passengers to miss connecting flights in Charlotte. I had a two hour layover before my last leg to Raleigh Durham International. Yet again, waiting at the gate for over an hour because the plane was late for arrival. The announcement for the delay came well after the plane was initially supposed to start boarding and customers were simply kept in the dark. Upon my return flight home back to Dallas, I was lucky enough to get a direct flight. And for a third time, the plane is delayed for “minor maintenance issues” but the announcement yet again came 20 mins after the flight was staged to board. All in all, I was an hour and a half late for return to my destination. I am a very understanding person and realize that unforeseen circumstances occasionally arise which may cause a delay to travel plans. I expect these things to happen and plan accordingly. However, these occurrences should be rare. A 20% delay rating is completely unacceptable for a major airline. They no longer care about customer satisfaction and pad your travel plans with a few extra hours of inconvenience if you do happen to choose this airline. No longer a reputable airline and won’t waste my money again.","Save yourself the massive headache and choose a different airline, even if it means paying slightly more.

Flight was slated to take off at 6:57. They told us 6:42 the flight was going to be delayed by 11 min. New departure time was 7:08. Told it was due to crew unavailability. Actually they were waiting for another crew in inbound from Washington. Only updates for the passengers in the gate area was they did not have any information. It was now 10:30 and it is apparent that this flight is not going to happen. Very shortly after that they had canceled the flight due to weather. Now its a party, every one lining up to find out when they would be rebooked. Most people would be booked on the Sun including myself. I did not want to waste my entire weekend at he PHL Airport. So I I decided to rent a car. Went to baggage claim one person was attending. He did not know when the bag would be available and would not file a report. Asked to speak to the supervisor. He tried a couple of time, but then gave up. We had over 60 people waiting for bags. And after 2 hours only 3 bags came down the belt. Very bad Management. Have to wait in queue to talk to Baggage service 3 times 1:43, 2:08, and I'm still waiting on the line for 1h 17m minutes to find out where my bags is. To all you wives, I want to thank you for your support as she couldn't sleep knowing I was on the road all night and kept me up. She decided to join the festivities and is calling on my behalf as well now. I even have enough time to finish this review. I promise I will never fly UN-AMERICAN AIRLINES again","Philadelphia to Cleveland. Where do we start! This is not my first Rodeo. I'm a Million Miler Diamond status with Delta.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was traveling with a party of 7, including one mobility impaired senior, and two boys, under ten years old who are on the autism spectrum (and prone to unexpected violent outbursts). We proactively had all of us wearing name tags with the age on the 4 youths. The flight attendant was very attentive and friendly,-taking care to address each one of us by name. He made all of us (especially the little ones feel like royalty). I credit the flight attendant for making the children's first airline flight to be pleasant and meltdown-free. I would give him 10 stars for his service. As for the overall ""first class"" experience, I would rate it a 7/10. About 10 years ago, the AA 1st class experience was noticeably different than coach. I paid the extra cost for all of the family, hoping to secure a designated 1st -class steward. I wish AA would go back to the special treatment, bigger seats, more leg room. However, overall, I believe that the flight attendant (I wish I had gotten his name), used his available resources to make the flight as premium as possible.","I was traveling with a party of 7, including one mobility impaired senior, and two boys, under ten years old who are on the autism spectrum (and prone to unexpected violent outbursts).

During boarding I was the last one in line. The two ladies working the flight were very rude and crass. This is the case with every US airline. One day they will get their justice. The flight attendant did his job and no issues with him. I do want to mention a service agent, I had left an an envelope with 1600 dollars. The gentleman found my number and called me and I went back to the airport to claim. That was an extremely nice thing for him to do. I wrote an appreciation letter to AA for his honesty. Just an average flight, nothing to get excited about.","Due to my late arrival on ANA from NRT NH012, I had to cancel my Delta flight back to RST.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew from Nashville to Quito with an hour stop in Miami in late July 2022. Flight to Miami was fine, apart from the ludicrous check in system that took about an hour longer than it needed to. Once we got into Miami we found our next flight been delayed about an hour. No worries, even multiple hour delays are expected sometimes, I can deal with that. But from there it got ridiculous. Boarded the plane in Miami, sat on the tarmac for two hours with no refreshments while the cabin crew made up excuses. First it was technical issues, then a shortage of crew members, then finally no pilot. We were asked to exit the plane but assured it would be a short delay. Once we were off the plane they cancelled the flight and told us to get into line for rebooking. The rebooking line took 9 HOURS for us, but as more and more flights were cancelled, people were standing in line for up to 15 hours! When we finally reached the front of the queue we were told that the flight was cancelled due to weather, despite being told that there was no captain, and witnessing a multitude of other flights taking off and landing during this 'weather'. Because of this blatant lie of a cancellation reason we were entitled to nothing but a seat on the next flight out (for us 24 hours later). We wanted to fly back to Nashville that night with a refund so we could rebook with a competent airline, but we told ‘you can’t because it was cancelled due to weather’. No hotel vouchers, no food vouchers and even the free water bottles and single cookies had run out 5 hours prior. Not even an apology. There was a group behind us flying somewhere else that would miss a funeral if they couldn't leave the following morning and were just told 'too bad'. We were forced to sleep on the filthy floor of Miami Airport in 20 degrees C (68 F) aircon all night. Finally we made it to Quito where of course I discovered that they had lost my backpack. It has now been two days with no updates and I am stuck in 5 degrees C (41 F) weather with nothing but a thin jumper and shorts, on my honeymoon. This airline actively hates it's customers and will never lift a finger to help you, despite receiving billions of your taxes in bailouts over covid. I will never fly with them again and you should avoid them like the plague. Absolute joke.","Flew from Nashville to Quito with an hour stop in Miami in late July 2022.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my plane ticket to travel to Mexico on June 24th to July 13th, I bought the insurance sold with the ticket online to not have any issues while I was in another country.

Wrong! there was no way to change my ticket and the insurance i bought was totally useless!  That insurance is not good for sickness, accidents or for any flight changes. I did not get any help. Since my ticket was a round trip, I thought I could still travel to Mexico to visit a family member at the hospital and return as planned on July 13th.

Under AA’s policy, the airline should be the one offers passenger food when this type of delay occurs! I called customer service to see if they could accommodate her trip back since that delay will cause her to spend no time with family and fly back 5 hours after landing. The agent was extremely rude and told me that there will be no accommodation and that weather is caused by god.

✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible experience. I was stranded in Washington Reagan airport for 12hrs on my way to Toronto from Chicago because the 1st flight was delayed and the worst is I was made to sleep in the airport because they said they don't have hotel voucher. And I almost missed the next flight because they switched gate numbers 3 times in a matter of 2hrs. Had I not checked the boarding pass online every now and then I could have been delayed further. I will never use this airline again and I recommend others to do the same.,Terrible experience.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible and inconsiderate AA Agents! This trip was a family vacation which we thoroughly enjoyed except the travel through AA airlines enroute from Chicago to Charlotte. Original flight was at 10 AM and was delayed to 2 PM due to maintenance, there was absolute no update from any agents on the terminal till 2 PM . When approached the customer service desk they mentioned that passengers will be compensated with $12 meal voucher for the inconvenience (really AA this is your class?) .

Pilot makes an announcement after 30 min into boarding that the flight is not ready for takeoff due to faulty system and we were bought back to terminal and had to off board. Saga continues. We head to AA customer service located at Terminal K to check if we can be accommodated to next flight, here we meet our super hero Greg (AA customer service representative) who was rude, shame of himself calling an AA representative. He was mean and making himself look like a fool. He didn’t want to do his job but rather show his dominance on customers as if we are asking share of his paycheck.

"Not Verified |  This has been an absolutely comical experience. Horrible. Set to have a flight from Birmingham to Dallas for a short layover then Dallas to Boise. We all loaded on the plane just fine, sat there for quite some time, then backed away from the gate, for the pilot to tell us there was an issue with the plane. We waited for an hour to see if it was going to be fixed. It wasn't, which was fine, I'd rather to fly with an issue, but from the time we were told we would pull back in to getting back into the gate it was 30-40 minutes. Most of us were already missing our connecting flights. All 50 of us got off the plane and went to the gate agent - the 1 gate agent and waited for 3 hours to figure out our connecting flights. They couldn't get this poor gal help at all. It was ridiculous. She was so calm and sweet and patient and I felt so bad for her. By the time we got up to her there were absolutely no flights left so we had to get a hotel voucher to stay and try again the next day. The only flights available the next day took us from Birmingham to Charlotte, then over Birmingham to Phoenix then to Boise. However, from Phoenix to Boise we had an extra almost 2 hours delay. We all loaded onto the plane and waited, and waited, and only one update came very quietly that told us we were waiting for a flight crew. It took an hour for flight crew and the pilot informed us there was another issue now with this plane. I mean it's a little bit ridiculous. I know some things are unavoidable but American Airlines doesn't have a very good reputation as it is and this trip certainly didn't help.

"Not Verified |  Our recent experience with American can be classified as nothing less than disastrous. Our first flight departing at 6 am was delayed 2.5 hours due to operations doing nothing after the flight crew had been delayed the night before causing them to be unable to fly at the departed time - our gate agent had no idea and we literally sat waiting as the gate agent didn't know where the flight crew was until the pilot explained upon arrival. We should have missed our next flight but that flight didn't have a flight crew either which we learned while waiting for almost an hour to rebook the next flight. That's where we thought we lucked out but not so as the second delayed flight took off only to make an emergency landing because as pilot #2 announced ""the cabin is getting smoky and the front of the aircraft is smouldering."" We were able to land safely (kudos to the pilots on that as we were very grateful) and deplane under threats of arrest at which point we sat in an airport for over 7 hours with 4 different iterations of what was to occur including getting a different plane to fly to our original destination at two separate times, than staying in the local of the emergency landing with no transportation to hotels 30 minutes away, to than flying to Miami to arrive and wait an hour and a half in a line to obtain a hotel and $12 meal vouchers which could basically buy a coffee at the airport. We had to wait so long at the rebooking that by the time we got to shuttle station, the shuttle was no longer running and had to take a cab for $40. The saga continued on the way home with the first delay being 30 minutes for our flight which might have enabled us to make our connection but alas, that delay turned to an hour at which time it was announced that our plane was still in Cuba. Apparently when the first delay was announced just moments before boarding, American wasn't aware of where there plane was? So we were told to go to rebooking again to wait another hour and a half in line to be told we couldn't get a connection from Philadelphia to Manchester until 2 pm the next day and were provide courtesy of American Airlines a night stay at the roach bag hotel which upon looking up the hotel to ensure it wasn't at such a distance as our previous courtesy hotel, saw the atrocious reviews. I tried to have that changed to wait on hold for almost an hour and a half to be told we would have to go to the rebooking desk in Philadelphia to change it. Well that was a joke as the flight was so delayed the rebooking desk was closed. My spouse thought how bad could it be - well the reviews did not exaggerate - it was disgusting. We lost four days of our vacation due to the incompetence of American Airlines operations and spent more than 12 hours in lines for rebooking. Customer service is even more of a joke - American sent us 10,000 miles for the first set of flight fiascos and after lodging a complaint on round two of the incompetence. I received what appears to be a ""stock"" response that I was ""clearly disappointed"" and between both incidents given 15,000 miles which the value doesn't even cover the costs of food and cabs that we incurred being stuck at airports and crummy hotels.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to maintenance issues, our first connection flight was delayed an hour and a half causing us to miss our flight to our destination in Cabo where we had already paid for our stay. We would only be about 20 minutes late to Dallas where we were scheduled to get on the last flight to Cabo. With all the flying we've done in the past, it's pretty common for flights to wait on connections that are running late, not obsurdly late, but 15-20 minutes is not outrageous. Not only did our last flight leave on time, it left EARLY. But by that time AA had already rescheduled us for the next morning which was infuriating having to be at a wedding that we did not know if we would make considering how the first flight began. If there had been any other option at this point, we would have picked up and gone with another airline to get to where we needed to go, but there was nothing. We were given $12 meal vouchers to use in Dallas that we were told should work at most places even ordering to the room. They did not work that night. We found out from a different AA agent that they were only good to use in the airport. They did not work in the airport on the way back either. $12 does not get you much of a meal in the airport. We spent $20 on an airport Subway sandwich that we shared, two bags of chips, and nothing to drink on the way back. On top of being stuck in Dallas for the night at a hotel that smelled like dirty diapers, we had no luggage for the night and were told it would be in Cabo for us the next day. Calling customer service for help from a person is impossible. They continue to route you to complete a refund request online, any information they ask for errors when trying to process your information.

"Not Verified |  I have already written two other reviews here about this trip. I am writing a third review to let everyone know the results of my lawsuit against American Airlines. Hopefully these facts will help you in deciding to fly with them. I brought a suit in small claims court, because American denied two refund requests after they cancelled my flight. They claimed that no seats were available to continue my trip for 5 days. This stranded me at DFW. I sued for the price of my ticket plus my lost non-refundable lodging and other fees at my final destination. I also sued for punitive damages due to their two denials of my refund. Within three days after I had them served with the court summons, I received an e-mail that they had approved the refund of my ticket. I lost the case. American, like all other airlines, has themselves insulated against claims like mine in huge volumes of tariffs and other legal documents. When you purchase a ticket and check the box that you agree to their terms and conditions, you are agreeing to their ""terms of carriage,"" which is a contract. Since the hearing was a breach of contract case, the judge dismissed punitive damages. She also found that they were not in breach of contract.

He than calls 1800 number and infront of me, makes it a point to ask the agent on the other end. So, the customer should call you correct? He should not come to my desk with this correct?  I decided to walk away and when I went to boarding my seat was deleted and I had to wait an extra 5 min for the boarding agent to give me a different seat.",2024-04-27,LAX-JFK,Unknown,None,Staff Service,0.11750000000000001
"Not Verified |  I bought 2 round-trip tickets to Germany from Utah. My husband and I had been saving our money for a long time to take this trip. We bought the tickets in September 2021, expecting to fly in January 2022. As of December 2021, Germany announced ""red flag countries"", which meant all countries listed on a ""red flag"" list were required to quarantine for 2 weeks upon arrival in the country, due to Covid-19. The United States was placed on that list late December 2021. With our trip being 1 week long, a 2 week quarantine was not possible. We called American Airlines and were told by a representative that our tickets could be applied/credited for another time within 1 year of purchasing. In May, the US was allowed into Germany without quarantine, and we called American Airlines to apply our credit to a new flight. We were told that the previous representative had lied: our tickets were not eligible for credit, and we revoked our money when we canceled our tickets in January. We complained, and received $100 to spend by September 2022. With airline ticket prices as they are now, that is almost nothing. This trip to Germany was a huge goal for my husband and I, and we are nearly starting from scratch now, having lost all the money spent. American was not understanding of the situation, despite it being Covid-19 related. We are extremely disappointed and have tried to fight for more from American Airlines, but it's been useless.","I bought 2 round-trip tickets to Germany from Utah.

I haven't always had my flight number handy but I always have my name and advantage number and they refuse to help me without it even though I know they can.

I was bullied by a flight attendant when I tried to get up to stretch because I have a serious disability which precludes me from sitting for long periods.

"✅ Trip Verified |  A never ending nightmare! My flight from Dallas to London was cancelled for technical reasons 10 minutes before boarding. I obviously lost my connection to Berlin. It was 11pm, hundreds of people in the line to get rebooked on another flight, only 4 people from the staff were working. After hours of frustration and waiting in the line, American Airlines announced they will close the counter. At 1.30am they left all the remaining passengers at the airport without providing for an Hotel voucher, food or the possibility to get re-booked. They said they would open again at 6am. At 5.30am the line is already huge, at 6.30am still none is there to work. Finally a girl calls the assistance asking where the hell they are and they send one person to work. At 8am I finally get re-booked on a flight to Frankfurt. Of course I have to pay another 100 euros of train to Berlin from my own pocket. Cherry on top, they lose my luggage. At the gate the lady tells me that my luggage went on a different flight and she starts lying and saying that it's because it will get faster to Frankfurt than me. 5 days have passed and still there are no signs of my luggage, which I probably won't see anymore. I got home after almost 3 days of no sleep and extreme physical and mental distress. I've traveled a lot and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. They treat people like garbage and don't take any responsibility for the awful experience they're putting you through. it's absolutely unacceptable and I sincerely hope they shut down and burn. I will never flight again with this company ever again, even if they paid me a million dollars.","A never ending nightmare!

When we landed, we found out our connecting flight was at a gate quite a ways away, we were given no help in getting there, so we ran and got there a couple minutes late, and it turned out that connecting left early. No one offered any help, so we had to walk to a “Rebooking Center” and wait in a line for 2 hours. Still waiting with little progress.

AA planes no longer have in seat TV screens; however, each seat has a personal device seat back holder that one can affix a personal device. Aircraft was very clean and cabin crew very friendly. Food service consisted of pretzels and soft drinks. Very much appreciated the pilot informing us that because of bad weather in the mid Atlantic states he would take a detour to get to PVD from CLT. This added about 40 minutes extra to flying time but it was better than being stranded. All flights with the exception of CLT-PVD leg were on time. Only negative is why if someone is paying additional monies for Main Cabin Extra one has to board in Group 5.

There was only one flight out of Charlotte, and I had allowed a lot of time to ensure I would make that connection. But, the delay was too great. American would not hold the connecting flight, even though it was the last flight out and they would only have had to wait about 15 minutes for us. So, I was stuck overnight. They sent me to a hotel with a voucher with someone else's name, which I didn't notice. Then, they spoke directly to the hotel and invalidated my voucher after I was showered and settled in. They didn't contact me directly at all and refused to take my calls. The hotel told me American Airlines said I ""didn't qualify for a hotel voucher."" So, being trapped overnight doesn't get you a hotel? So, I had to pay out of pocket for a hotel to which they had sent me. Garbage airline with rude workers. When I was stuck overnight by Southwest last year, they gave hotel vouchers out without any question at all. So, this is specifically American Airlines that treats people this way.

"✅ Trip Verified | Venice to Phoenix via Philadelphia. American Airlines was a nightmare. As we landed in Philadelphia, our flight to Phoenix was cancelled. We stood in line for hours to re-check in our luggage after custom and to find out if there were other flights. We were treated by the American Airlines staff as packages. The lady that did my check in in Philadelphia had me pay again my extra bag saying that it was overweight. I had already paid the extra bag in Venice. She told me that I was lucky she did not charge me more. My son said that a bag doesn’t just gain weight on a flight, and it all seemed very suspicious. She told him that she did not talk to children. My son is 18 and in college. Her attitude was horrible. I ended up having to pay another $100. She disrespected me and many other passengers. We were placed on a flight for Las Vegas, but after 2 hours on the plane, they had us all get off the plane. The reason: crowded air traffic and no pilots available. We had to wait 3 hours in a long line to find out what was next. Midnight approached. Only 3 people were working with hundreds of passengers in line. Some had small children. One had a very tiny baby. Some had pets. Some were elderly people who were struggling and tired. Some did not speak English and did not understand what was happening. All while one of their staff members was laughing out loud while telling us that none of us was gonna get on any flight until Friday. Her attitude was inhuman. Passengers pay her pay check, and she was treating them like garbage, laughing at them. People were crying and in emotional distress. It was heart breaking. Around 1:00 am, we finally got boarding passes for other flights. However, we had to pay our own Uber and hotel because the flights were the day after and no vouchers were given to us. At 1:30 am, the American Airlines staff stopped serving those passengers that were left in the long line and shut down the assistance. Those people were left hanging until the day after. Some won’t reach their destinations until Saturday night. This is unacceptable. My son and I got extremely sick. I won’t go into detail, but all of this affected other plans and a work trip I had coming up on Sunday. Can’t travel if you are sick, and American Airlines is responsible for every bit of it.

Then in O'Hara the connecting flight had to u-turn it back to Chicago where we were told to please wait while they were diagnosing a problem.

So I had to use a old fashion phone box in the customer assistance program to get me on a united flight at 730a on Sunday. This came after they said that they lost the luggage because the plane rolled away with our bags on it. I did talk to customer assistance and they said they would deliver my bags.

They gave us $12 for food where almost the entire terminal was closed. And $12 in an airport is nothing. They would not cancel the flight and it kept being delayed from Saturday night to Sunday morning at 1030, then 330p. I called the airline but everything was closed at 430a. So I had to use a old fashion phone box in the customer assistance program to get me on a united flight at 730a on Sunday. This came after they said that they lost the luggage because the plane rolled away with our bags on it. I did talk to customer assistance and they said they would deliver my bags. A week later I only have my main original bag but not my carry-on. They said because it had been over a week with no one claiming it it was sent to their warehouse. I have been on the phone, chatting, emailing, and contacting them like crazy and still nothing. If I ever get my bag back I will be grateful but I won't use American again.  I would also like to add that I cannot get reimbursed as almost everything in the bags was on the ""Cannot Reimburse"" list.",2025-10-01,LAX-JFK,Leisure,United,Baggage,-0.01217948717948718
"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines delivered the worst travel experience of my life. I am a platinum frequent flier and have flown on over 15 different airlines. Internationally - they are hands down the worst. After making changes to my itinerary due to “schedule changes” that had not actually occurred (I confirmed by searching the flight status of the flights I was originally booked on, and ending up on some of those flights), they advised me that a number of flights in my itinerary were now full and I could not be rebooked. After solving this myself with the codeshare airlines they had booked me on, their advice turned out to be completely wrong and I ended up on my originally booked flights - though they continued to claim my tickets were cancelled. They then tried to cancel them again when it was confirmed I was still booked on the flights. No reason, no communication, just simply poor systems, incompetent staff and bad customer service. Once I was on my trip, they failed to issue tickets for two legs, which resulted in me spending over 6 hours on hold with their call centre, to again receive no assistance in resolving the issue. Staff from British Airways ended up helping me resolve the problem on both occasions. Their customer service and ticketing are completely and utterly incompetent and their systems are fundamentally flawed. Towards the end of my trip, they cancelled a leg of my return journey with no information as to why and no offer to re-book or resolve the issue, which resulted in me having to pay an additional $1000 to book a flight on another airline to make my connection from the US to Australia. I’m now struggling to get any kind of refund or flight credit for the flight they cancelled. On top of their administrative incompetence, their inflight service was appalling. Revolting food, rude cabin crew, filthy aircraft and shocking ground service. Their entertainment system was bad (at best) and they charge top dollar for inflight wifi that doesn’t even work. Honestly, I am extremely easy going, and always incredibly friendly to airline staff - there are just zero redeeming features for this company and I didn’t come across a single member of staff who seemed to know what they were doing or how to resolve issues their company had created. By the end of the trip I had spent over 10 hours of my vacation on hold with their customer service department to resolve issues of their creation. I wouldn’t wish a flight with American Airlines on my worst enemy, and will pay whatever is required to never fly with them again.

"Not Verified |  They delayed our flight due to ""engine issues"". Then they got another plane for us, that also somehow has engine issues. They also said they were looking for a crew, but why when we just had a crew on our original flight. They kept delaying the takeoff time. They did this about 5 times, and 8 hours after the original flight was supposed to leave, they canceled it. Then they basically told us we could rebook at the counter or get a refund. I believe that that second we got off our original plane they knew we would not be taking off. When looking out the window at the second plane you could see nothing was being done to the plane, no luggage being moved, no refueling, and no maintenance being done. They gave us a $12 meal voucher as an apology, but at 10pm at night most of the places to eat were closed. The line to rebook took us 2 hours to get through, we were toward the front. The flight they were able to rebook us on was a total of 21 hours due to long layovers. We were flying to Germany for a wedding/reunion and now because of the flight being canceled we would no longer make it there on time. It also cut our trip short by a full 3 days. I am extremely upset. I haven't seen my family for over 6 years, and this airline ruined it for me. I have a friend that works for American and she basically told me when staff is low, they cancel flights and claim ""engine"" trouble as the cause. This seems to be very true, and the total disregard for people returning home or getting to where they need to be is truly awful. Why would a flight get booked without a crew. It makes no sense. This airline has really scarred me from flying. I will never in my life fly American again and I will pay more if I have to, to fly on better more reliable ones. I know covid caused staff shortages, but this is not the first time me or my family have had issues flying with them, even prepandemic. I would really recommend flying any other airline.","They delayed our flight due to ""engine issues"". Then they got another plane for us, that also somehow has engine issues.

"Not Verified |  This is the first, and will be the last time I fly with American Airlines. The tickets were outrageously expensive. The only reason we bought them was because they were the only airline going to Kentucky during the time we needed to be there. My husband and I have said that if that’s the case in the future, and AA is the only one going, we won’t be going to the event and will happily miss it to avoid ever giving this company our money or time in the future. A couple of weeks before our flight they emailed saying our first layover went from two hours to 6 hours. On the first flight, the flight attendant was very rude. She told me I had to put my carry on in the overhead bin. I explained that it was made to fit under the seat, but she told me it needs to go above. I started getting it ready to put it up there and she shut the door on the overhead before I could stow it and walked away… ok, so I put it under the seat. And it fit perfectly fine, just like it has on so many flights before. I had a cup with water and ice that I was finished with and asked her if she could throw it away for me. She said no!  I couldn’t believe it. I put the cup in the seat in front of me. I fell asleep, we were on a red eye flight. The cup ended up spilling and got all over myself and my husband. Our flight on the way home was delayed, so we ended up missing our connecting flight. They only let us know that 1 1/2 hours before the flight. We could have stayed with our friend if we had had a heads up. Instead of sitting at the airport for 20 hours. We were told they put us on the 8am flight, with 2 stops before we got home. But turns out we weren’t .. we were on the 8pm flight. They put us in a hotel which was kind of helpful. We decided to go with another airline to get home the next morning. When I went to the ticket counter to tell them to cancel our flight she informed us she could get us on standby at 9:30, or regular booking at 11:30. Both have now been delayed. They’ve already told me they don’t know where my bag is and will call us when it arrives in SLC. I called to express my frustration with the airline and see what was going on, and why so many problems. The manager didn’t care at all. She didn’t even say sorry for the inconvenience. She was completely monotone and said they would not do anything to compensate me since I still took the flight. I usually don’t write reviews, or complain about employees, this is only the 2nd review/complaint I’ve ever written. But I felt it necessary because of the horrendous experience we have had. I want to warn others about this airline and save them from having the experience we’ve had. Needless to say we are delusional and exhausted from the run around, changing of gates, times etc. We could have driven home faster, and I’m fully regretting not doing that at this point. Save your time, money and sanity and do not book with AA. And btw, we had three friends fly out of Kentucky with AA this weekend and they all had similar experiences. Two of them had to drive to another airport and pay $1,000 each because of the runaround AA puts their customers through. Never again from us, and I hope you don’t support this company either.

"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines failed me again yesterday (June 16 2022) and ruined my weekend. It was a clear, sunny day in Phoenix, just pristine conditions for flying.  At first, American didn't start boarding, no information was given to the passengers. Then at the time of the flight, the flight was postponed by 30 minutes, then within a few minutes cancelled. No reason was given and desk agents refused to help anyone, provide any information and rudely told us ""I can't do anything, go talk to customer service"". After speaking to the horribly rude customer service rep, I was told there's no seats on any flights to Atlanta for the next 3 days. I was supposed to be in Atlanta, attending my friend's wedding in Atlanta but couldn't because American couldn't fly on a clear, sunny day with zero clouds in the sky. I missed half a day of work for this, paid for cab rides to and from the airport and now I've got to pay to ship my gift. This isn't the first time American has let me down, I've been on 5 American flights .. one 5 hour delay in NYC for a slight drizzle, one 4 hour delay in Chicago for no reason, then the last minute cancellation on a pristine, sunny day with zero clouds in Phoenix yesterday. Worst part about the 5 hour delay is, they made us sit in the flight for 4 hours without AC, masks on, no food and suffocated us. Then they didn't even bother to offer an apology. Just an absolutely useless and unreliable airline. Never flying with this airline again.","American Airlines failed me again yesterday (June 16 2022) and ruined my weekend.

✅ Trip Verified |  This was a horrible trip. Supposed to be a 4 day weekend. 2 days were used traveling thanks to American Airlines changing our flight to a much later flight in the day leaving Philly and adding a layover. No explanation for that but customer service was very unhelpful and my call disconnected twice after being on hold forever. Flight home was delayed all day. No reason given just hours of delays. The worst part was they damaged my son's tuba in transit and absolutely refuse to accept responsibility for their bad handling. They tried to imply we caused the damage. Absolutely infuriating to basically be called a liar. Baggage claim representative did not care one bit that the tuba is permanently damaged thanks to their negligence. Awful airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines has to be the most jumbled mess of an airline that I have ever flown on in my life. My children and I have been stranded in Charlotte for over 13 hours. Berated and yelled at by the AA staff things like (at 12am when we landed) stating they would not release our bags, doesn’t matter if we have medicine in them that we need or not we aren’t getting OUR bags. The overnight staff were some of the most unprofessional staff I have ever come in contact with. They give no cares about anyone here. I heard a TSA agent say close to 3000 people were stranded. We have never been offered water or snacks, we cannot go back upstairs to get food and there are mo options other than a single overpriced vending machine that was half stocked. My children have slept on the floor now for over 7 hours.  And not ONE AA employee or management has come by to any of us, some passengers have infants for gods sakes and they are even holding their car seats!! This airline, this staff at CLT for AA is a joke. So much so the local news came and did interview. This is not right. Not to mention we still don’t have our checked luggage and the current wait after we have been here for 13 HOURS is 3-4 more hours. There are no rental cars, no hotels and over 500 people waiting for Uber and taxi alone! They stopped answering the Uber requests over night it was so bad. As a mother traveling with two children I am appalled by how American Airlines has handled this. It may have started due to weather but this is all due to a lack of management, training and customer service. Never again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have only flown AA twice. Both times, nothing but horrible. This last time was the worse experience I have had ever traveling. Was flying out from Norfolk Airport traveling to Albuquerque. Flight was scheduled for 5:15pm, I received a text around 2:30ish that my flight from Norfolk to Dallas was cancelled. Waiting in line at the service desk, the AA worker (nicest worker and best encounter all day) told me to hop on this flight that was going to Charlotte then to get on one from there to Dallas. Was worried, I thought everything was good. We land in charlotte, I had about 20 min to get to the connecting and ended up being delayed 45min. I wasn’t worried because I had a 5hr layover in Dallas. Land in Dallas and I decided to sit at the bar for the 5hrs to have dinner and some drinks to waste time. We are supposed to board at 10:50pm to go to ABQ. Everyone is lined up at the gate ready to board and 3min before boarding. (Not even exaggerating. Literally 3 min before boarding) the flight gets cancelled. We’re waiting in line at the service desk. Everyone is going crazy. I finally get up to the desk, this was the last flight of the night. Next option was to stand on stand by for the 4 different flights that were all sold out to Albuquerque tomorrow. (This was the option for everyone on that full flight. You think stand by was going to happen for everyone? NO.) so I ask the worker to put me on standby or what my options were to get home sooner. He tells me the next flight he could get me an actual seat on would be for Monday. That is Two days stuck in Dallas. I have work on Monday, this was not an option for me. I asked him about cancelling my flight and what AA would cover if I have to just get a rental car and drive. He said “because of the circumstances, AA could refund you up to $200 for your rental alone.” I said “perfect. Cancel my flight now and I will book a rental for tomorrow morning.” I then asked him “what about a hotel, are you guys going to pay to put me in a hotel tonight?” He said “AA will be sending you a link for some hotel choices to book and be covered under them.” I received the link, they gave 3 hotel options. All of these hotels were sold out before even getting the link. I showed him and he said “pick a hotel and AA will reimburse you $125 for a hotel, just save all of your receipts and send everything in. I booked the hotel, he gave me vouchers for the taxi. Everything is fine. Next day, rental car cost me $444 ($200 of it being refunded at time of delivery) not including gas. I finally get home after driving 10 hours the next day. Submit all my receipts and the issue and AA responds a week later “we can only give you a refund for the amount that the connecting flight to your destination was.” $57 it was. Then I replied “no, this work told me everything would be reimbursed, $125 credit in hotel and my rental would be taken care of. All three of my flights that day had issues, I was stuck in Dallas, and you guys wanted to keep me there 2 extra days stranded” they respond “my apologies I can give you a check for $100 for the hotel. And $100 in flight credit only. The guy that told you about the rental was wrong.” American is the worst airlines, I have never had some many issues with an airline and now I’m out of $300 that will not be refunded because the crew members didn’t want to “show up”. Absolute joke! I will plan a one way trip with that airline just to get use of the credit and never fly AA again.","I have only flown AA twice. Both times, nothing but horrible.

There are no nonstop flights from AUS to RIC, so on my outbound flight, I connected through Charlotte (CLT).

I travel a decent amount and I have never had so many issues until now and so happens this is my first time flying with them.

"✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Las Vegas. The only good thing I have to say is that the planes are very comfortable. But that’s all. My husband and I had our return flight home to Las Vegas booked out of Miami for 6/10 at approximately 6:30pm. Our flight was delayed due to “maintenance” repeatedly every 30-45 mins from 5:30p until 8:30p. Then they reassigned our plane and gate and updated us to a 9:40pm departure. We were given very minimal information during this time. Finally at 11pm, they advised us that they no longer had a pilot and would be cancelling the flight. They sent us to the rebooking counter, which had a two hour wait to be helped. When we finally got to the counter at 1am, almost every flight to get us home was already booked because, as our gate attendant advised us, we waited too long to adjust our flights. We requested compensation and we’re not offered any. Instead they directed us to email customer service (which we did and received an automated response for a 7-10 business day or longer response during peak travel times). The gate “manager” offered us two $12 meal vouchers for the ADDITIONAL DAY of travel - one of which did not work when we went to use it. Finally, we inquired about a hotel for the evening, but they were “sold out” because we (once again) “waited too long.” We were offered to book our own room and receive a $150 reimbursement - good luck finding a hotel room in Miami at 1am on a Friday for that price!

Period.","Miami to Las Vegas. The only good thing I have to say is that the planes are very comfortable. But that’s all. My husband and I had our return flight home to Las Vegas booked out of Miami for 6/10 at approximately 6:30pm. Our flight was delayed due to “maintenance” repeatedly every 30-45 mins from 5:30p until 8:30p. Then they reassigned our plane and gate and updated us to a 9:40pm departure. We were given very minimal information during this time. Finally at 11pm, they advised us that they no longer had a pilot and would be cancelling the flight. They sent us to the rebooking counter, which had a two hour wait to be helped. When we finally got to the counter at 1am, almost every flight to get us home was already booked because, as our gate attendant advised us, we waited too long to adjust our flights. We requested compensation and we’re not offered any.

"Not Verified |  Had a flight from Las Vegas, that was delayed two times. After the second delay, my connecting flight was missed. After getting to Phoenix an hour plus after the time I was supposed to be there. We stood in line for customer service to get updated flight and after standing in line for an hour and a half, we were told that window was closing and we had to walk to the other side of the airport. We then waited about another 45 minutes trying to get flights and ultimately had to get a room voucher and a taxi voucher. However if you are given the voucher for the Hotel San Carlos depending on the time, save yourself a trip and find somewhere else. This particular hotel is ancient. It’s definitely not even worth the voucher. Checked in and immediately we decided to get out of there even though it was 2 am. We knew we would not be able to stay there. Unfortunately I would say try flights from somewhere other than American Airlines. Save yourself some time and even with all of that some of the staff had a nerve to be rude.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Although they have slightly more comfortable seats and amenities like the phone charger, none of it is worth it when i have to run from gate to gate because they change the gate 30 minutes before the flight.  I had to run for my flight every single flight. The first time i wasn't prepared to be a track star and I made it to the gate 10 minutes before departure but the gate was closed. There was no one at the gate to help me find a desk for support. I found the desk for support and they mocked me like i was responsible for the last minute gate change.  WIFI was $13 per hour or $17 per flight, no option to purchase a day pass and they had a count down timer they literally gave me 1 hour, despite the plane not having signal for 9 minutes. All these terms and conditions on the website so i doubt i can request a refund but a more practical thing to do would be to either give a person an extra 15 minutes or give a day pass. Especially when you don't offer direct flights, so it's like you automatically charging $26 - 34 per day for bad service.  I lost my headset at DFW, I go to the lost and found, the lady didn't even acknowledge A customer at her desk. (airport had 2 lost and found areas) I finally got her attention, explained I lost my headset, she asked when, I told her this morning she didn't have it OK, i asked if she could call the other lost and found perhaps someone turned it in at E terminal. She said no in the most unapologetic way have me a paper with the website and told me that all she could do. i told her i was aware of the website but the website also had the Terminal listed as a location for LOST AND FOUND.  Also forced me to check my bag, I specifically bring a 1 gallon bag with 20 different travel sized bottles like the airport request because going to claim bag area is time consuming, but they forced me to check my bag.

All these terms and conditions on the website so i doubt i can request a refund but a more practical thing to do would be to either give a person an extra 15 minutes or give a day pass. Especially when you don't offer direct flights, so it's like you automatically charging $26 - 34 per day for bad service.  I lost my headset at DFW, I go to the lost and found, the lady didn't even acknowledge A customer at her desk. (airport had 2 lost and found areas) I finally got her attention, explained I lost my headset, she asked when, I told her this morning she didn't have it OK, i asked if she could call the other lost and found perhaps someone turned it in at E terminal. She said no in the most unapologetic way have me a paper with the website and told me that all she could do. i told her i was aware of the website but the website also had the Terminal listed as a location for LOST AND FOUND.  Also forced me to check my bag, I specifically bring a 1 gallon bag with 20 different travel sized bottles like the airport request because going to claim bag area is time consuming, but they forced me to check my bag. Why offer people the ability to bring one bag one personal item, when you really can't bring one bag and one personal item.",2023-12-22,JFK-LHR,Leisure,None,Staff Service,0.07792063492063493

The guy next to me was on standby and had been told he wasn’t gonna get on because the flight had too much weight, yet they still boarded everyone. We sat on the plane for over an hour. By then it’s past midnight and we go to get a new flight. Best they can do is next day and they said they can’t offer us hotel because it’s a weather related cancellation? Um, no it was due to being overweight and the crew being late. We barely got a rental car and a hotel for the night at 3 am. Not only this, but we can’t get any of our bags for 6-12 hours because it was checked baggage. So now we are stranded with no clothes, toiletries, medications, etc. American does not care.

Not Verified |  So I don’t know what kind of stupidity happened but this is the worst airline in the whole world. Flight from ATL to MIA on May 28th 2022 was scheduled from 5.55pm with arrival at 7.55pm. The cabin is an E170 with a 2500miles range. Now the distance from ATL to MIA is roughly 700miles that means the cabin should always arrive with excess fuel and also be able to handle about 4hours of extra flight time. However not this time. Miami had bad weather and asked for 30mins holding time and the pilot said we don't have enough fuel so we have to go to Fort Myers. I’m sitting in Fort Myers right now for about 2hours waiting to get fuel so we can go back to Miami. This was a weekend trip and I’ve already lost a whole night. This was the stupidest thing and it’s clear the issue wasn’t the weather but their lack of fuelling the plane back in ATL.

I then went to customer service where I was told the next flight I could catch was 6 hrs away and given a new boarding pass. I waited at the gate for a couple of hours and watch several other passengers running and missing connecting flights that were barely closing their doors.

We flew with a 1 hour delay to JFK, we picked up our pilot and filled the fuel (means one hour and a half in the airplane) and then flew to Dallas. In Dallas airport, while they knew what was going on, there were only 3 people at the counter to help anyone who lost connection flights. 10 people ahead of me and over 50 behind me in line. Everyone tired and frustrated. They send us to Hotel and already booked a flight (Dallas -Chicago) and (Chicago-Calgary). So we had over 8 hours flight with layover to get to Calgary. They wouldn't accept that My kids and I don't need to fly to Chicago,  and if we would fly through Chicago, why didn't you let us out in JFK to send us to East (Toronto/Montreal) and send us home!  It was longest flight. They could sort their manifest and be more helpful.",2024-11-28,DFW-ORD,Leisure,None,Staff Service,0.22222222222222224
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the American Airlines flight to LAX, even though I was in First Class, the flight attendants couldn’t even be bothered to give us a glass of water or champagne before we took off. It took nearly an hour to load that international flight. On the flipside on my one hour flight from LAX to Phoenix the lovely flight attendant gave us all drinks before we took off. I am done flying American internationally. The service is the worst of any airline and the prices are the most expensive of any airline.

We asked the attendant to help us make our flight from the first flight and she did not. When we landed, 2 of us ran to the connecting gate and when we arrived the staff was rude. When I tried to explain the situation, they cut me off from talking, and instructed me to get on the plane. I tried again to explain we had a pregnant person with us that could not run, which they proceeded to tell me it was my fault for scheduling my flight through Dallas. I suggested maybe next time making an announcement or updating the time on the app, which they proceeded to cut me off and commanded me to breathe. I was out of breath from running in full sprint because no one let us know our flight would be held and I was out of breath from the situation this airline caused with a lack of communication. I’ve been on flights with Frontier where they are more helpful and responsive with delays and they’re considered bottom of the barrel.

We finally boarded with a flight crew, but after the doors were closed, we were deplaned since the crew ran out of hours.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Thanks, American Airlines for saving my vacation to Cabo! During my travel from MSY to Dallas, I unfortunately left my passport with TSA in New Orleans. I did not realize I didn't have my passport until I was about to board my flight from Dallas to Cabo. So, of course, I missed my flight and proceeded to look for my passport. After approximately 2-3 hours, I eventually found it located in New Orleans. I needed to get it from New Orleans to Dallas to continue my travel. I met this wonderful flight attendant Aimee, who was on the 2:00 pm flight from Dallas to Cabo. I was traveling with my daughter and niece. We had decided that they should go forward to Cabo, and I would try to get there later after retrieving my passport. Aimee heard my story, and she was very sympathetic and wanted to help. She then started making phone calls and went well beyond her expected duty to find a pilot who was in New Orleans who was willing to pick up my passport and bring it to me in Dallas. Captain Dewenter accepted the call and went above and beyond to help me during this devastating time. His actions along with another flight attendant saved my vacation to Cabo. And if things could not get more complicated. The flight to Dallas from MSY where the captain was delivering the passport was diverted due to weather. He was then grounded. Fortunately, he was able to connect with another flight attendant who would be coming on that flight around midnight, and she delivered my passport to me at the Dallas airport. I had gotten a reservation at the Hyatt connected to the airport for the night. At approximately 2 am, the flight came in from Laredo, TX and I met Mary in the airport to retrieve my passport. Long story short, I was able to catch my flight out to Cabo the next morning. I am forever grateful to Flight attendant (Aimee), Captain Dewenter and the flight attendant (Mary) who finally delivered passport. This is exceptional service provided by American Airlines and I know this is not expected but so very appreciated. Sometimes the little things you do can mean lifechanging results to someone else.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew with American 4 times over course of an 8-day trip to Costa Rica, and every single flight came with its share of issues and delays. Starting with the first flight, where we had tried to change our seats (for a fee) at their kiosk earlier but the feature was not working. When we got to our gate we stood in line at the gate agent’s desk for 25 mins before anyone came over to help us. During that time we watched several employees talking and working but no one attempted to assist us for close to a half hour. After that when my partner voluntarily checked his carryon, as it was rather large, to make more room for people bringing on smaller bags, they forgot to actually put his bag on the plane, so when we arrived we had to wait and then file a baggage claim. On our return home we had a connecting flight with a layover in Charlotte, NC. The plane circled on the tarmac for close to 30 mins while they figured out which gate we were going to use, making us late to arrive so we had to run to customs, run to security and then sprint to our gate where we, and close to a dozen other people from our first flight, arrived a few mins before the plane was set to take off. We were told we would not be let on the plane. I understand the “once the door is closed that’s it” policy airlines have, but when so many people were missing their flights home one would think they would be more accommodating; they were not. The next possible flight was 12 hours later, and with the entire airport shutting down we asked about a voucher or compensation for a hotel for the evening but we were told no because “it was not their fault that we missed our flight”. I asked how the delay on the runway was not the fault of the airline and were essentially told “it’s seems like it should be but we can just blame security lines”. So without any luggage or personal items since our bags were headed to Chicago we paid for a hotel room. After we arrived the next day and had to wait to talk to baggage services, even their employee at the desk seemed shocked and surprised we were offered no compensation for our experience. She was very helpful and honestly the first employee of American Airlines that seemed to care about our experience and customer service. We were told that “American apologizes for the delay/inconvenience” over and over again throughout our trip but no one ever apologized, offered us a refund for the flight or bag check or our hotel expenses. It was an overall frustrating experience and clear that customer service was not important to their company.","We flew with American 4 times over course of an 8-day trip to Costa Rica, and every single flight came with its share of issues and delays.

Avoid American Airlines at all costs. I can honestly say we won’t be flying with them anymore.",2025-04-10,LAX-JFK,Leisure,None,Booking App,-0.0451388888888889

"Not Verified |  A summation of incompetence by American Airlines. My family and I made the horrible mistake of flying to Hawaii on American Airlines on 4/13/2022 or we were supposed. When we tried to start our flight, American Airlines had understaffed their ticket desk at the airport. Two ticket agents were trying to handle three flights worth for passengers. Multiple of the automatic ticket machines were broken or out of paper. By the time we got through the line to check our bags our flight had already left. So, the ticket agents booked us for 4/14/2022. We went home, repacked so we did not need to use checked bags and waited for next day. 4/14/2022 we get through TSA and board our flight to Chicago. The flight was delayed because of a ‘mechanical problem’ whatever that means. We arrive in Chicago, have our lay over and then get on our flight for Dallas-Fort-Worth. Again there is a delay because of ‘mechanical problems. This delay was much worse and by the time we landed in Dallas our connecting flight to Hawaii had already left. There are no more flights out of Dallas that day to Hawaii and we are stuck. American Airlines handed us coupons for food, $12 a head and for a stay at a nearby days in. Family and I head to our hotel and spend the night. On 4/15/2022 in the hotel shuttle going back to the Dallas-Fort-Worth airport I ask the driver if they know much about these hotel coupons we got from American. Drive claimed that for last 11 months American had been sending 25 to 50 people a day to their hotel that had been marooned in Dallas of problems like ours. I have no way to confirm the drivers claim, but it sounds true to me. Once on our flight to Hawaii the plane has backed away from the jet way and the pilot comes on. There will be a delay departing because of… “mechanical problems”. Three flights and each one had mechanical problems.  Clearly, they are short staffed, not just the ticket agents but also, I am guessing the mechanics. Again, three different airplanes and each one was delayed with mechanical problems. The only reason my family vacation was not totally ruined is we scheduled extra time off on the front of the trip to spend in Oahu. That and I have travel insurance for our hotel stay on Oahu and that allowed me to get a refund for the missed nights and shore excursions. In the end we were able to make our scheduled cruise that departed on Saturday the 16th. My request to American for a refund got me an offer of $50 a head in vouchers and in the hope of, “rebuilding your confidence with American Airlines, and hope you'll give us the opportunity to provide you with a more positive experience in the future."" Clearly some marketing group came up with that phrase. My fellow air travelers my recommendation is never use American Airlines.","A summation of incompetence by American Airlines.

"Not Verified |  I last flew international with American August of 2019, and I should have taken that hint the first time. The seats on this flight are tiny and so uncomfortable, they overbook the flight and offer travel vouchers but never take people up on their vouchers if they offer to switch flights. When i asked about seat upgrades, I was told it would be $3000 on top of my $2000 ticket to upgrade from main cabin to premium economy. That was an absolutely ridiculous price. Every international trip I have had with AA to or from Japan back to the United States has been less than ideal, and uncomfortable. The wifi on this flight was unresponsive for the first two to three hours, which was another frustration in and of itself. If you have the choice of flying through JAL, even if you book with the American Airlines site, take It. It is worth every inconvenience to get on a JAL flight opposed to an AA flight.

"Not Verified |  We arrived at Will Rogers airport for our American Flight 4678 from OKC to Washington DC. Flight was due to leave at 5:07 for Washington, DC. We arrived and checked in and went to our gate. At approximately 5:15 we were notified that there as a delay due to mechanical problems. When 5:45 came I went to the counter and informed the agent (Zachary) that we only had 1 hour connection time in Washington, and if the plane did not leave soon, we would miss our connecting flight AA5669 from Washington to Bangor, Maine. I was informed at that time they were working on the mechanical problems but at this point he didn't know any further information. By 6:10 we were well aware that we would not make our connection. Once again, I went to the counter, and was informed that we could either wait for this flight, and get to Washington and then we would be given a food voucher, and accommodations there, and get the first available flight out from Washington to Bangor in the am. So, we decided to wait as by then we already knew we had missed our connection. Then an announcement was made at 6:57 pm that now due to weather issue there would be a further delay, we watched as the crew members came back into the gate. So, then I got in line to find out what next? The agent was alone at the counter, and there were many people lined up. When I spoke to him, he again said we could stay in OKC and be provided a food voucher or hotel, or we could wait until the storm passed, and do the layover in Washington and they would provide us the food voucher & accommodation in Washington; he found an early flight from Washington to Bangor for May 3, 10:10 am Flight 5107, and we got our boarding passes for that flight to Bangor in the morning. When we finally left Will Rogers, we arrived in Washington around 2:00 am. In flight we had no meal, as the food (which we were told was roast beef) had been left out too long and they did not feel safe in serving it. WE lined up at the Customer Service counter for our food voucher, and accommodation, and were told that the flight delay was an ""act of God” : By the time the weather was an issue we would have already missed our connection due to mechanical issues as they were NOT completed in time for us to make our connection. Had we known that we would not have been provided for in Washington, we would have stayed in OKC. with full accommodations. Needless to say, we had to stay in the Regan airport in Washington, DC for the night. Nothing was open to get food. I am a Type 1 diabetic, and hadn’t eating since lunch time on May 2. Thankfully, I had my insulin, and medication with me, and one box of orange juice. However, here we were two senior citizens, flying first class – we were exhausted! I understand that for some, their connecting flights were missed because of the storm, but ours was not, it was mechanical issues which were not completed in time to make our connection.

"Not Verified | London to San Jose via New York JFK. Do not fly American - we've flown on some poor airlines in the past, but American has to be the worst of all. Too many examples of poor customer service to list here but some highlights include: Check in: I don't begrudge anyone who is willing to spend the extra for first or business class although if you are thinking about it, I wouldn't with this airline but AA should really have a priority check queue especially for those passengers, they shouldn't allow the “priority passengers” just to walk to the front of the economy queue as they arrive leaving the ""lower classes"" including many families that have been standing at the front of the queue for an hour watching on!! You can't imagine how frustrating this was and how irate the other passengers were getting - there was nearly an uprising! Seating: even though you might think that you as a family have seats booked together and this is clearly shown on the plan of the plane on the AA website - don't rely on this, the check in staff think otherwise and will place you in random places on the plane when you arrive at the airport - we as a family of four were split up on all of our flights, on one particular flight it would seem that the rows of empty seats at the back were required for the cabin crew who needed 3 each to sprawl across whilst having soft drinks and pretzels and watching their iPads, the cabin crew are obviously overworked and need time to relax! The cabin crew aren't very accommodating at resolving these sort of issues and you just have to get on with it.

"Not Verified |  I go into this review understanding this has been a doozy of a year for the industry but never in my life have I experienced this. A girl friend and I were able to get a last minute ticket to Florida from Phoenix. We had a connecting flight in Houston (getting in at 11.30pm on Thursday) with our final flight to Miami the next morning, Friday, at 7.20am. We get into an extremely empty airport and look up at the board to check our morning flight to find it cancelled, they sent us an email that this connecting flight was cancelled 8.02 while we were already in the air. We find someone still working and ask about another flight, he was so dismissive. He literally waved us away while telling us that our app would have more options than his computer and said this while walking away into a terminal door. We had no idea if he was coming back. When he did, someone else was there and the original guy finally took interest in helping us. We knew this wasn’t his fault but we are two young moms away from our families for the first time now stranded in a different state. He said he could offer a hotel but that it “wouldn’t be the nicest”, even though there was a hotel in the airport but he said he had no access to it, oh and that the transport ended at midnight so we’d have to hurry (literally would give us only 10min to get out of the entire airport). He then offered to put us on standby for a flight the following morning, Friday, at 5am and then booked us a flight at 6pm in case we couldn’t get on the morning flight (missing half our trip but at this point something was better than nothing). After an extremely glamorous stay in the empty terminal we woke the next morning and checked our app only to see that he had booked us for 6pm the following day, Saturday. There was at least 15 other people on standby for the flight so we didn’t get on, effectively ending our attempts to get to Miami. The entire time they said it was cancelled because of a domino affect caused by weather, there was multiple people from our group already there sending us videos of clear skies. Three other people from three different locations were all able to get to Miami just fine and to add salt to the wound, exactly 10min after our original cancelled flight, another airline to Miami left right on time from the same terminal. When we finally got on a plane back home (after spending 15 hours in the airport), I was getting leaked on by, what I assume, a weird condensation build up in the window when we were descending, it wasn’t just a drip, it was a lot. So when we landed I told the stewardess, just to let them know in case something was wrong and she said “well do you want a napkin or something? There’s nothing I can do about it” I’m an overly polite person and I just can’t get over how rudely we were treated, constantly. We were told to call for refunds once we were officially home and when we finally did, I did talk to an extremely nice gentleman but was told that we may just get a ticket voucher, even though we also paid an additional insurance fee. We are still waiting to hear back (via phone or email we were told) almost two weeks later and my friend checked online to see the status and it was denied but when you click to go further into the site, it still shows a weird pending but of only $125, the ticket was $638.

Well cut to the layover as we are waiting to get on our flight home the weather in Dallas is beginning to rain and our flight gets delayed 3 times then cancelled entirely. We rebook one immediately for 3 hours later than our original flight, then that flight gets delayed 3 more times. All while tons of flights at the airport are being cancelled and the bad weather is scheduled for another 6 hours I expected that our rebooked flight would likely be cancelled as well and the customer service line already had at least over 300 people in it so we got in line to speak to someone regarding what the next step was if this flight got cancelled as well since that one was at 11pm and I didn’t plan to sleep at the airport. Meanwhile the airport employees are referring us to call the customer service line so I called them while we waited in line. Spoke to a staff member who was very polite and understanding but didn’t have a resolution for me so I held for over 2 hours to speak to her supervisor. After hours in the line we made it to the front and the lady was less than helpful and completely rude. Her resolution was that she could cancel the flight we had re-booked and rebook us at the earliest 9pm the following day with no accommodations because it was “weather related”. I again explained that we were not supposed to have this layover to begin with. Her resolution to that rather than admitting that that is poor customer service on Americans part was that I should have complained when it was changed. So me being nice and letting that slide was now my fault so you’re encouraging that I complain in advance next time? She then said I was being disrespectful and asked me what I wanted from her. I simply explained that I wanted accommodations if the rebooked flight was cancelled. She told me I would have to get back in line (the line that now has well over 800 people in it) when that flight was cancelled. I asked her to just place a note in my file that we had waited 3 hours in the line already and that we were requesting a hotel accommodation if the flight was cancelled. She said a note isn’t going to do anything everyone else is waiting too and slid me back my ticket and called up the next customer. The other party that was with us was asking the other attendant for the same thing and the lady got extremely hostile and defensive and said “Are you trying to fight me?” None of us were being hostile towards them so for an employee to speak to a customer in that manner is completely unprofessional. Cut to after we left the counter with no resolution I finally got a supervisor on the line and she was very polite and willing to hear me out but unable to help me either. Then we finally get on the rebooked flight, just thankful that it wasn’t cancelled at this point then get on the tarmac and have to sit there for over an hour behind 15 other planes and then they lost our luggage to top it off which also happened at the DFW airport the last time we had a lay over there too. So disorganized, insulting and distasteful customer service.","To begin, I booked our flight to Tampa from Phoenix in January. Paid extra to have a direct flight home from Tampa to Phoenix.

"✅ Trip Verified | I recently had the displeasure of booking a flight for my son and I on American Airlines. We were to fly out of DCA to Boston Logan.

They re-routed our flight to refuel without notifying us, causing us to be stuck on the plane for 5 and a half hours without food except pretzels, and the delay made us miss our connecting flight home. When asked what we should do, the flight attendant looked me up and down and told me to run (I’m 6 months pregnant and traveling with a toddler).There were no other available flights to get us home that day, so we had to get a rental car and drive for hours. When I tried to call customer service I was told multiple times that I need to send an email because no one actually works in customer relations and that no one would help me. I was given a laughable amount of “trip credits”, which I am unable to use and asked if I could have my money back for the flight they caused us to miss. I was told I was lucky to even get flight credits and that they wouldn’t help me any further. Everyone I spoke to, including supervisors, had an extremely hostile attitude. On the actual flight the Wi-Fi wouldn’t work, my tv screen didn’t work and it was extremely hot on the plane.","Worst customer service experience I’ve ever had.

"Not Verified |  I am writing this message as a very frustrated customer. I have attempted to be patient but when American Airlines lack of commitment to deliver, poor on-time scheduling, and frequent cancelations on flights cause issues where they affect my livability and work it is a severe issue. I expected to board my flight (AA2915) at 3:28PM; however, upon my arrival to the airport I came to find out my flight had been cancelled. I was patient with the agent but when they advised me that the earliest they could get me out on a guaranteed seat was Thursday, I had no option but to go on stand-by. This was havoc since the passengers that were not able to fly were also on standby, so it was a hefty list. I was unable to board the 5’ish flight since it was overbooked by over 30 people. My original ticket was to leave Tampa and my destination was Columbia, SC. I spoke to the agent downstairs once again since the gate agents were bombarded by people and pleaded because I needed to leave that Sunday, and the agent was very condescending which I grew very irritated. They gave me a ticket for 6AM the next day to just go to Charlotte on standby and I will drive 2hrs from there. That is the extent of frustration, and disappointment due to the unreliability in travel arrangements is costing me. The following day I got to the airport bright and early to finally board a flight and TSA did not let me through since they stated my ticket was not valid and it did not have a gate. I explained this is the ticket that was issued to me and they apologized but could not let me through. I had to go back down to the terminal and once again wait in line for 30 minutes and have the agent go through their process. They told me I will be missing the flight and they will reschedule me again. This is the 4th attempt! I travel frequently for work and only use 2 airlines but the fact that every time I fly American there seems to be an issue even when the weather is good. Both days there were sunny skies and clear of clouds. If it staff issues I recommend hiring more reliable people, if it is maintenance hire more techs, if it is operations the get them retrained. Time is money and I had to lose a day of pay, get lectured by other people because now I look unreliable. Now American is literally tarnishing with my livelihood and my hard-earned reputation. This has happened to me 3 times in Texas and now once in Florida. It is either extended delays over 12hrs or cancellations. Now to add to it I have to drive 2hrs to get to my final destination.","I am writing this message as a very frustrated customer.

"Not Verified |  I would give -1000 if I could. My flight was cancelled 7 times in 3 days, no response from American, they just reschedule me for a trip 4 hours later and cancel again. In the end, at 3 am after being hours on the phone waiting for a representative, and after I had to buy a last minute ticket with Delta to get to my destination, they extortion me. The representative wasn’t really happy when I tell her I was flying with a different airline, given the 7 cancelations. She threatened me to cancel my whole trip unless I bought an upgrade to first class. Given I had just spend a lot of money on a last minute ticket, I couldn’t afford for my flight back to be cancelled. I filed a bunch of complaints, they took a month to answer and offered me 5,000 miles for the trouble, as if I was going to fly with them again. After that, they tried to throw me out of the first class ticket they forced me to buy, because the representative at the counter “couldn’t find me” in first class.

My flight was cancelled 7 times in 3 days, no response from American, they just reschedule me for a trip 4 hours later and cancel again. In the end, at 3 am after being hours on the phone waiting for a representative, and after I had to buy a last minute ticket with Delta to get to my destination, they extortion me. The representative wasn’t really happy when I tell her I was flying with a different airline, given the 7 cancelations. She threatened me to cancel my whole trip unless I bought an upgrade to first class. Given I had just spend a lot of money on a last minute ticket, I couldn’t afford for my flight back to be cancelled. I filed a bunch of complaints, they took a month to answer and offered me 5,000 miles for the trouble, as if I was going to fly with them again. After that, they tried to throw me out of the first class ticket they forced me to buy, because the representative at the counter “couldn’t find me” in first class.

"Not Verified |  Ridiculous team work, terrible maintenance crew, and disorganized. We had a wonderful vacation with a connecting flight in Dallas TX. First of all security was incredibly rude literally yelling about everything. Our flight was delayed an hour and a half or so due to weather. We were basically last to board the plane. They did not do maintenance checks before boarding the plane, there was an error with an oxygen cap or something. Took maintenance forever to get over there, pilot tried to update passengers said probably a half hour. That passed, estimated another half hour so they could pick up a part, then another to complete paperwork. Then we did take off checks. Started taxi and light came on that the door was not sealed where they did the cap replacement took so long, then they were waiting for more help to back up the plane! By the time we took off we had boarded the plane for 3 hours. I traveled with small children who watched two movies during this time. I get there wasn’t much the crew could do but why weren’t these checks done before loading the plane, not to mention all that time during the weather delay. I felt like I was questioning how prepared the plane was to leave, with how maintenance had to come back and forth three times and couldn’t do the job completely the first time. My children and I are utterly exhausted our flight should have been 2.5 hours and we were on the plane 5plus. It was incredibly hot before take off, my feet were aching and swollen. I felt like my families time was not important to anyone. Again our flight crew was adequate. Obvious that whoever they were radioing to help was not helpful. What a waist of my life. I hope to never fly with you again.","Ridiculous team work, terrible maintenance crew, and disorganized. We had a wonderful vacation with a connecting flight in Dallas TX.

"✅ Trip Verified | Reno to Punta Cana. 2 weeks before our trip, American Airlines cancelled our flight to connector DFW from Reno (where I live). They booked us leaving from Sacramento (2.5 hour drive away) 14 hours before our original flight on Friday night. Being employed, this ended up falling at the beginning of my workday. Contacted phone support, waited 1.5 hours on hold to let them know we couldn't leave in the middle of a workday and let them know Sacramento was 2.5 hours away. They scheduled us into Chicago through United for Saturday morning around 00:30. I rented a car for $125 + $60 in gas to make the flight. On the way back our flight was 2 hours ahead of time. We left for the airport only to find it was actually going to be on time. So we were 5 hours early. They additionally booked our connector with 40 min to make it through customs, baggage pickup, baggage recheck and across DFW. We missed the flight by less than a min, they had just shut the doors even though they verified we were on our way. The attendant told me, ""We have a choice to wait or not - we didn't."" We then went to customer service, who booked us a flight to LAX with a 9-hour layover to connect to Reno. They additionally put us in a hotel. Upon landing we found out the hotel was 36 miles away without a shuttle. When I asked for a different hotel voucher, the attendant found one next to the airport. We walked back to the shuttle line and I thought maybe I should check the hotel. Upon calling I found out they had been sending people away for 2 hours because they were full. I went back to the counter, who found another hotel with a vacancy. We slept for 4 hours in the room stinking of marijuana, woke up to take showers, bought some bathroom necessities and donned the clothes we'd been traveling in for the previous day. Thankfully our flight was on Alaskan, so there were no more troubles from then on. Note: I was a loyal AAvantage cardholder before this. I will find a way to spend all of my miles and then never use that card or fly on American again.","Reno to Punta Cana. 2 weeks before our trip, American Airlines cancelled our flight to connector DFW from Reno (where I live).

"Not Verified | Tampa to Memphis. American lacks proper etiquette in all respects, their flight attendants and customer service staff are horrid.

The customer service rep was rude and gave no reason as to why the amount could not be refunded to me. Instead he refused and hung up the line. Not only did I not get my money back, on the second flight a flight attendant decided to single me out for wearing headphones during the safety run down. I did not realize that was taking place because we just boarded the flight. I got off the phone and simply told the attendant I was sorry and unaware and she told me to not to talk back to her and that I was interrupting. TO NOT TALK BACK TO HER!? I found that to be outrageous considering I wasn’t “TALKING BACK TO HER” and in fact being the complete opposite. The fact that this flight attendant thought it was okay to talk to me as if I were her child left me almost speechless until I realized the people sitting right next to me were playing games on their iPad and decided to say something because I was evidently singled out!! I paid over $600 flying with American just to be treated with disrespect. I will never fly with them again. I will always fly with Delta!

"✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Punta Cana. Literally the worst experience EVER. I fly quite frequently and have never experienced such incompetence. I don’t know it it is just the Philadelphia employees who are notoriously rude and unhelpful or what. We are 2 adults flying with 2 young children (ages 8 & 5). When we purchased our seats, we chose 2 & 2 so there was 1 parent with 1 child. However, when we checked in, we were separated from our children. First, we tried the online chat, that person merely told us our assigned seats, which we already knew since that was what we were calling about. Then we called the customer service line and were told we had to talk to the person at the airport. When we arrived at the airport, we checked our bag through and our passports were scanned. We were not given paper tickets nor told we needed them AND were told we needed to speak to the person at the gate about our seats. We waited and waited for gate personnel. When they finally arrived they just started boarding. We finally got to the front of the line and were told “5 yr olds can sit alone.” This is unacceptable. They expect and think it’s ok for a child in kindergarten to sit next to a complete stranger. Then as we were boarding we were told our passports were not “verified.” Ummm, what? YOU scanned them! Such incompetence is astounding. If I practiced with such incompetence in my job, people would die. Once on board, every single family was separated from each other. It was pure chaos as people attempted to make seat switches. It was like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. It seems all of this could have been avoided if families were seated together to begin with. When purchasing tickets, the birthdates of the passengers must be entered. Seems like they could figure this problem out easily with a simple algorithm. There is no “AAdvantage” to flying American Airlines.","Philadelphia to Punta Cana. Literally the worst experience EVER.

"✅ Trip Verified | Traveling when you are handicap with limited income is a nightmare. And if you are a black handicap woman that ""looks"" healthy, the situation gets quicksand sticky! Well, I have never had such a horrible flight experience as I had with American Airlines. I was coming back from Hawaii on April 2, 2022 - April 3, 2022, after releasing all of the stressors the world is throwing at me, I received all of them back with a snap of a finger. Still in recovery from a surgery, as well as other conditions that has deemed me permanently disabled, I requested a seat with more room to be able to move around and/or stand when necessary. I attempted to do so on my reservation by online, 800#, ticket agents, supervisors, and gate attendants. Everyone up to the gate attendants said ""we have no control over seating until you get to the actual gate for that flight"". Once I get to that gate, waiting in line for 45 minutes, the attendant seemed so overwhelmed and uninterested in my situation that I was cut off mid-sentence with ""we don't upgrade anybody unless you pay for a seat"". Now they are calling my name for pre-loading over the intercom, there are 30+ more people behind me, and the flight is boarding...I either pay the money or be uncomfortable.

As if that isn't enough, when I arrive at my layover, there were no wheelchairs waiting for me or the other 6-7 people whom requested it and when 3 wheelchairs did come, the gate representatives made the decision on who gets a wheelchair versus who rides the handicap cart...I had to ride the cart.

I tell her that I am hoping to get a seat with a little leg room, ""NO MA'AM, this is a full flight and I can't move people around,"" then walks away from me. I have never been so glad for a vacation to be over and it was because of this flight. On my way to the airport, I remember saying ""I needed this relaxation"" due to the past year I've been having health wise, to be completely disregarded. I forgot to mention that my seat was dirty and sticky, and my neighbor's was broken so we were stuck with a light on for an overnight flight! My advice to consumers, if you are disabled do not fly American!","Traveling when you are handicap with limited income is a nightmare. And if you are a black handicap woman that ""looks"" healthy, the situation gets quicksand sticky! Well, I have never had such a horrible flight experience as I had with American Airlines. I was coming back from Hawaii on April 2, 2022 - April 3, 2022, after releasing all of the stressors the world is throwing at me, I received all of them back with a snap of a finger. Still in recovery from a surgery, as well as other conditions that has deemed me permanently disabled, I requested a seat with more room to be able to move around and/or stand when necessary. I attempted to do so on my reservation by online, 800#, ticket agents, supervisors, and gate attendants. Everyone up to the gate attendants said ""we have no control over seating until you get to the actual gate for that flight"". Once I get to that gate, waiting in line for 45 minutes, the attendant seemed so overwhelmed and uninterested in my situation that I was cut off mid-sentence with ""we don't upgrade anybody unless you pay for a seat"". Now they are calling my name for pre-loading over the intercom, there are 30+ more people behind me, and the flight is boarding...I either pay the money or be uncomfortable. So I say ""fine, upgrade me"", thinking I will just have to be very frugal this month after spending $150 for leg room.

After multiple phone calls to American Airlines to resolve the situation, and not getting anywhere, we used a family member's miles on another airline to get him home.

After filling out a missing items form they only credited less than 40% of the items actual worth. Second time around they forced us to check bags before boarding the plane even though they were within the required size and weight. I argued that they were within the limit and told them of my previous experience. The control freak flight attendant then tried to threaten me stating I wouldn’t be boarding the plane and asked me to get in the back of the line.

Between TSA and re-checking our bags only to miss our flight due to AA bag recheck rule. I will never go through MIA again or do my best to bypass American Airlines all together. I would not recommend AA to anyone. Just avoid the stress all together.",2023-12-09,LAX-JFK,Leisure,None,Baggage,-0.11363636363636363

"✅ Trip Verified |  The aircraft itself is not uncomfortable - I am used to Delta but have flown with a few other airlines and this one was fine. The flight attendants were very nice. What I am super disappointed and annoyed about is that my flight from Cozumel to Miami was delayed so I missed my flight. Customs in Miami only had like 3 lanes open and both customs and security were severely backed up. I was not acting entitled or asking to skip the line, but whenever I did have a question for the TSA agents (or any employee in that area, they might not all have been TSA) either ignored me or responded very rudely. They first laughed in my face and said that everyone still has to go through security, when I asked if he recommended a speedier line. I was not trying to bypass security, just save time, which I think is reasonable. I went to ask another man for directions and he shook his head. I was starting to get lost, went to ask another woman a question and she pointed me the wrong way and then was rude when I tried to explain that that wasn't what I meant. So I missed my flight, whatever.  I sucked it up and continued through security while trying to find a new flight back home to Nashville. On the AA app, which had my boarding pass, it said my flight had been delayed. So I ended up still walking to the gate, where the lady behind the counter ignored me for a solid five minutes. I know her job is hard and she was busy, but it was humiliating. When she finally looked up, I asked if they were still boarding - since, as I said, the app showed a delay that made me believe I could still make it. She quickly muttered ""it left"" and went back to her work. So I go get a coffee and empanada from the Cuban cafe to make myself feel better - highly recommend. I ran into a super nice flight attendant who helped me figure out how to find customer service. I wish I had gotten her name, she was so sweet and helpful and patient. I headed to customer service because neither the app nor the website reflected that I had missed my flight - as I said, it showed ""delayed"". So I couldn't figure out how to switch to a later one and wanted in-person help rather than talking to a machine on the phone. That's reasonable. The customer service line was insane. Two desks opened at first, eventually a third person showed up. I waited in line for two hours, easily. With an insane stroke of luck, I ended up with a man who was very kind and efficient. He was able to get me a straight flight back home instead of some insane connecting flight out of Fort Worth at 12AM. I had just spent all day at the Miami airport being humiliated by many of the staff. I'm glad it ended on a good note (even though my straight flight was also delayed) Overall, not happy with American Airlines or the Miami airport staff.","The aircraft itself is not uncomfortable - I am used to Delta but have flown with a few other airlines and this one was fine.

At 8.29am we received another notification that the flight was delayed again until 4.10pm. 35 minutes before takeoff at 8.56am we received a notification that flight #5685 was canceled.

We could not miss the event. We decided to change the flight #2244 traveling from BNA to DFW at 5.37pm and drive 2 hours and 53 minutes by rental car. The flight #2244 was also delayed twice. Once to 6.05pm then to 6.29pm. We rented a car for $349 at the DFW to drive the remaining way. Paid for in full up front during booking. Once we got to the DFW airport rental car location. That there were no more cars available at any of the rental car locations. Our rental was through Thrifty. The Manager said that the 3rd party sites were overbooking and that they were only honoring reservations older than a week. So at that point we were all stranded at DFW. We called shuttle/car/bus services, with no luck. We finally found a cab that would drive us to Shreveport from DFW for $450 cash that we borrowed from a family member. At that time it was after 12am, we arrived in Shreveport after 3am. This was a horrible travel experience. We are all very disappointed customers. Looking forward to hearing how AA can rectify the situation. Their response was a month late and they said sorry bla bla bla.

"✅ Trip Verified |  American has been reducing steadily service and quality since Covid - and it is being noticed. My flight from Charlotte to Evansville was 1hr 20min, but no drink / snack cart was brought out. The attendant announced that drinks ""available upon request"" (and this has happened before), but only 2 asked for a soda. This flight had 1 open seat - due to the fact that American dropped the flights from Chicago to EVV forcing people to use Charlotte. The Admiral Club in Pittsburgh was closed 6 months in 2021 (for renovation) and is now open but closed on Sundays. And now the main club at Charlotte is down 6 months. The Platinum Pro / Sapphire phone-in number has a typical wait time of 3 to 4 hours, and then you get an agent with an Indian dialect that does not know how to navigate the Sabre system - so American has outsourced this service to India and I assume laid off the well trained U.S. agents we used to enjoy. Finally, American has changed their program to Loyalty points instead of flight miles and segments.

The Platinum Pro / Sapphire phone-in number has a typical wait time of 3 to 4 hours, and then you get an agent with an Indian dialect that does not know how to navigate the Sabre system - so American has outsourced this service to India and I assume laid off the well trained U.S. agents we used to enjoy. Finally, American has changed their program to Loyalty points instead of flight miles and segments. In short, American has systematically cheapened everything about their service - for preferred and non-preferred passengers alike.",2023-12-22,LAX-JFK,Business,None,Staff Service,0.036111111111111115

We missed our cruise. We had booked through the cruise so we would get better service and coordination. Our baggage went the same day to Fort Lauderdale and we couldn't. I was hoping they would coordinate and make sure we could get on the next flight and not miss our cruise.

"Not Verified |  Flying a half full planes certainly enhances the experience. We flew from Amsterdam to Dallas and onward to Acapulco. Premium Economy on AA's 787 is comfortable with nicely presented adequate food. IFE is great, crew nice. Flight on time with slightly early arrival at DFW. Immigrations and Customs absolutely horrendous, with 2+ hour wait. After eventually reaching front of the line there, we were simply waved through without even a look at our passport (after mentioning our connection to Mexico), This also happens on the way back. This was new and seemed our long wait even more a waste of time. Flight to Acapulco on Embraer in First (paid upgrade) that now comes with access to Admirals Club. Lounge (at DFW D terminal) wonderful. Seating in First (in single seats on the left) is comfy, catering just drinks and some snacks. Lovely crew and on time arrival. Our return was equally smooth (Acapulco Airport is really great) until reaching immigrations at DFW where situation was even worse as on the way out. So we missed our connection. Rebooking at arrivals very busy so left arrivals and went upstairs to check in. No issue in being rebooked to next day. No offer for assistance in accommodation but also didn't ask. Check-in agents first come across as a bit harsh, but warm up when you just go along. Next day, purchased access to Admirals Lounge, again such a nice experience. Return flight to Amsterdam on-time, about 60% full, lovely and funny crew. Smooth flight. The upgrade to premium is such value: space and catering are really upgraded. All in all a very good experience.","Flying a half full planes certainly enhances the experience. We flew from Amsterdam to Dallas and onward to Acapulco.

"Not Verified | Milwaukee to Cancun via Philadelphia. I will not only never fly this airline again, but I will also make sure none of my friends, family, and anyone that will listen never flies with them. Original flight from Milwaukee WI, with a layover in Philadelphia and final destination in Cancun. This is what has actually happened: Flight from Milw-Philly= delayed 30 min, delayed 30 min, delayed 30 min than after two flights, we could have switched to, left their gate my AA app told me the flight was canceled. After trying to get on any other flight to get us to Cancun we were told our only option was to leave two days later or drive 4 hours to Cedar Rapids then on to Dallas with a final destination of Cancun. We drove 4 hours to CR. Cedar Rapids to Dallas flight was delayed after we sat on the plane for 20 min due to a malfunction with the fuel door. We were going to miss our connecting flight to Cancun. We called AA three times and after finally getting someone that wasn't telling us there was nothing they could do we got someone to put us on another flight. The only thing is it didn't leave until the next day. If it wasn't for my travel agent we wouldn't have even known to ask for them to cover our hotel in Dallas for the night. No one even offered. We weren't offered food vouchers either. We went to get our bags to head to the hotel and nothing came on to the baggage claim belt. When we asked about our bags we were told that our bags will be on our flight the next day to Cancun and we could not get them. Not only that but my AA app was telling me that one of our bags was completely missing and not scanned. I called AA back to add two days to our trip and come back two days later. I was told they would only cover the flight if we came back one day later not two. If we extended our trip two days we would owe them $1065 per person. Not only that but in order to add an extra day we had to pay another $650 for our hotel room that would not be covered by our travel insurance. Fast forward from a night with no bags to the next day, the next flight. Dallas to Cancun. So far we have sat in this airport since our approval at 12 pm today waiting to board our 4:39 flight. In that time we have seen three flights delayed and one flight moved from Terminal A to Terminal D. At this point, it is 3:33 and our plane hasn't even arrived. The flight is now delayed to 5:05 and continues to be pushed back every 10 min. Never again American Airlines.","Milwaukee to Cancun via Philadelphia.

"Not Verified |  I would like to complain about the Customer Relations department which is the only department that customers can only write in to address issues and concerns via email. They never replied until I went through a reservation department yesterday. The supervisor of the reservation department was very nice and took an effort to bring forward my questions and concerns to the department. This morning at 8 am I received a voice call from the Customer Relations Department from a lady who claimed she is the executive administrator of the department. She elected not to align with my views and queries. I respected her decision. However, I told her what a lousy service her department has been provided and not the American Airlines that I used to like and know. She immediately changed her voice and tone toward hostility of my view. I told her I wrote four emails for more than 2 weeks and never get any replies from the department. I expressed that we as the Customers have no way to call and address issues and concerns to the executive branch of her department. She argued all emails were read by the executive branch. If this is the case, the four emails that I wrote should have been gotten a reply. She said that was the reason she called this morning. I told her she called not until I escalated my questions to the reservation department threatened to bring them forward to the CEO or go public to put in a review.

"Not Verified |  On January 23rd 2022 I booked a 4-night honeymoon vacation to Key West, which 2 roundtrip flights with American Airlines were part of. The first thing that happens to start the list of many problems is the first flight was cancelled due to weather. The AA agent at the airport told us they knew about this 4-5 hours ahead of time and no notification was sent to us, we checked all morning and the flight showed ""on time"". After waiting for two chances at standby for 5+ hours our only option was to book a flight the following morning that AA said they would book through United Airlines for us. No proof or tickets were ever given to us or offered at this point. We show up the following day for the make-up flight, and United Airlines tells us that American Airlines never booked the tickets properly and because of that, we had no flight. We go back to talk to AA supervisor, and she gives nothing but excuses (with no care about the situation) and tell me there is no way to print me proof that the tickets were ever booked. This mistake cost us two days worth of luxury hotel reservations. I believe the agent never truly booked us tickets, and used United as a scapegoat to cost us more money. They also shipped our checked bag to Key West on the initial flight to arrive to Key West 2 days earlier than we even could. I attempted to reach someone to discuss this through their phone system, and was met with 20+ minutes of holding to be told that internally American Airlines does not have a way for customers to speak with someone about the compensation they owe certain customers. Every step of the way American Airlines makes things as terrible and impossible as they can for their customers. Avoid this company at all costs.

We then stood in a line for 2.5 hours and were told out only option to leave there was to go to Texas and try and get a flight from there home the next day. So the following morning when we went to our gate in Texas to fly home we were told we were in the 20s on stand by. Only one stand by person got on that flight and so they rolled us to the next flight .. after 4 flights through put the day with no closer to getting on a flight, we tried to fly anywhere closer to the west. Just so we could drive home. But all flights were over booked and were told the only this to do was continue to wait for a stand by.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I hate flying on AA with a passion unknown to mankind. The reason I chose to fly from to MIA on AA recently is that it was non-stop-if either the really, really nice folks at SWA or even the marginally nice folks at Delta or UA had a non-stop on this route, I would have flown with them at up to double the fare-seriously-that is now much I hate flying on AA. I have NEVER had even an above average flight with AA & have been flying domestically & internationally since I was 20 & have no idea how many times I have flown with AA during that time but it has been at least a dozen or two times or more. That may seem hard to believe but it is 100% true.  Mostly recently, an AA counter agent at MIA misinterpreted what I said to another passenger in line. This happened a day after I missed my international flight due to their errors and they would not let me on the flight even though the flight had been delayed but they wouldn't reopen the door. They treated me like a child and made me wait until the end of boarding after another alleged agent manager admonished me for something I didn't have clarity on what I did. Then, after I arrived at my destination, I learned that their staff, based on hearsay, said I made some sort of vague ""threat"" I did not make to anyone (I was talking to someone on my phone so naturally they could not hear the other side of the conversation) and I was detained at immigration at my international arrival location and illegally held beyond 48 hours in a jail cell with no ability to contact the US consulate or attorney before I learned that AA had lied - they stated it was not their decision to then have me deported, but they started the process based on false info. I mean if there was really an issue, why did they allow me to get on the flight to begin with? Naturally, AA tells you nothing. It then took me over a week, a lot of stress, and a lot of money to the right connections to get back into the country of my final destination. I have suffered both mental and physical fallout from this situation, a complete overreaction by the terrible AA staff that had no basis in any reality or danger whatsoever. Of course when one reaches out to ""contact us"" at AA for weeks you get auto-generated e-mails then naturally, nothing-no response at all. This is after AA tried to ruin my life after I had just retired.","I hate flying on AA with a passion unknown to mankind. The reason I chose to fly from to MIA on AA recently is that it was non-stop-if either the really, really nice folks at SWA or even the marginally nice folks at Delta or UA had a non-stop on this route, I would have flown with them at up to double the fare-seriously-that is now much I hate flying on AA. I have NEVER had even an above average flight with AA & have been flying domestically & internationally since I was 20 & have no idea how many times I have flown with AA during that time but it has been at least a dozen or two times or more. That may seem hard to believe but it is 100% true.  Mostly recently, an AA counter agent at MIA misinterpreted what I said to another passenger in line. This happened a day after I missed my international flight due to their errors and they would not let me on the flight even though the flight had been delayed but they wouldn't reopen the door. They treated me like a child and made me wait until the end of boarding after another alleged agent manager admonished me for something I didn't have clarity on what I did. Then, after I arrived at my destination, I learned that their staff, based on hearsay, said I made some sort of vague ""threat"" I did not make to anyone (I was talking to someone on my phone so naturally they could not hear the other side of the conversation) and I was detained at immigration at my international arrival location and illegally held beyond 48 hours in a jail cell with no ability to contact the US consulate or attorney before I learned that AA had lied - they stated it was not their decision to then have me deported, but they started the process based on false info. I mean if there was really an issue, why did they allow me to get on the flight to begin with? Naturally, AA tells you nothing. It then took me over a week, a lot of stress, and a lot of money to the right connections to get back into the country of my final destination. I have suffered both mental and physical fallout from this situation, a complete overreaction by the terrible AA staff that had no basis in any reality or danger whatsoever.

He should’ve been brought to us with an assistant. Nobody called us informing us about Him which we were supposed to receive a call. We were at the airport until 2:30am waiting around hoping someone could give us answers as to where he was or where he was dropped off. We were at the gates since 11pm. We were roaming around the whole airport asking everyone for help and everyone there was useless. We eventually went home and didn’t get a phone call until 4am, my grandfather was outside in the cold, alone. He got his passport stolen his ID and wallet stolen. He is 87 years old unable to defend himself. This is unacceptable.

"Not Verified |  My bag did not make it from Miami airport to Atlanta airport like it was checked for. Instead my bag was sent to Houston, Texas. I made a baggage report immediately after getting off of my flight in Atlanta. The baggage office in Atlanta for #americanairlines was less than helpful. So I begrudgingly accepted their offer to have it transferred to Atlanta and delivered to my door. Well today in tracking my bag, it has now been to Houston, TX to Dallas, TX to  Denver, Colorado to  Atlanta, GA where for whatever reason it did not remain at said airport instead it was loaded onto a plane and sent to  Charlotte, NC now it is flying it’s happy self to Montgomery, AL. So here we are, my bag that was supposed to be on a straight flight from Miami, FL to  Atlanta, GA has now been to five *correction 6* different airports. Yet, no one. Not a soul has been able to tell me why it went to Houston to begin with or why after landing in Atlanta this afternoon it was sent to Charlotte, NC. I was assured that my bag is safe with the baggage claim people. But, can you really make that assurance when it cannot safely make it on a straight shot flight to the correct airport? Lesson learned. Check baggage claim statistics before checking a bag and never again with American Airlines. Disappointed, outraged and downright flustered is to say the least. Unfortunately I didn’t not pack my belongings with the assumptions my bag would be lost so when you see me sans makeup, and in a sports bra all week we can both silently cuss American Airlines together. Biggest waste of money checking the bag, should’ve just left everything I packed in Miami to begin with and purchased all new stuff. It might’ve been less frustrating to do that in the first place, but here we are. Needless to say proceed with caution. During my own experience I have seen numerous other HORROR stories of dealing with this airline and their inability to actually care for their passengers and belongings.

"Not Verified |  My son was booked out of Montreal to Raleigh Saturday morning. On Friday night, his flight from Montreal to LaGuardia was canceled - no reason given, presumably weather. They could not book him on another flight until 7 a.m. Monday morning. When he got to the airport Monday morning his COVID test was done incorrectly (his fault) but he was yelled at, had to pay $200+ for a new test, and then managed to miss his flight because of that and customs delays. It took several hours on hold on the phone to get another flight because no gate agents were available. The new flight went through Philadelphia with a 5.5 hour layover, and he had to pay for that - again, his fault, but if the original flight had not been canceled it wouldn't have happened because there would have been time to deal with things. Now his flight from Philly is delayed. Across the board people have been at best unhelpful and at worst flat-out rude. On his trip TO Montreal, his 6 a.m. flight from Raleigh (first flight of the day) was delayed and he arrived at LaGuardia with about 20 minutes to make his connecting flight, had to run to the next gate and then had the gate agent and the ramp agent yelling at him and each other about whether to let him on. They did, but none of that was his fault and he didn't need to be the one getting berated. I get that travel in the time of COVID is a nightmare and that people are horrendously rude. But a lot of people are just trying to get by, to follow the ever-changing rules, and to be polite. Things are confusing. Mistakes get made. How about not yelling at people for things that are not their fault? And how about not canceling flights for weather when the vast majority of flights into an airport at the same time are not canceled, meaning the weather really isn't that big of a problem. This has been an incredibly awful experience throughout the trip. After I had a horrible experience with American flight cancellations a couple of years ago, we're done with this airline.","My son was booked out of Montreal to Raleigh Saturday morning.

She never tells us options until she hands us our boarding pass. She said ""oh you don't have you're stuff right now, we are going to fight."" We had our stuff in our cars, since it was 12 pm and we thought our earliest flight we could get was at 6 pm.

"Not Verified |  I have had the worst experience with American Airlines this weekend trying to get back home to DC from Nashville. My flight was set to leave Saturday evening and was canceled at last minute due to “bad weather” even though it was sunny and nice out. Not to mention, I could see online that TONS of other flights, including those that departed after mine was scheduled to take off, were landing at DCA just fine. The clerk herself admitted that it did not make sense. The experience, however, only got worse… Everyone on my flight waited for hours at customer service for a resolution only to be told that we couldn’t get on another flight until Tuesday. The airline refused to offer a hotel discount, airline credit, or refund to anyone. Even though we were now stuck in Nashville for three days. When I found out I could be put on standby at 6 am the next morning, I asked and they wouldn’t even allow me to have a lounge pass so I could wait at the airport. I was then told the flight the next morning was overbooked by 10 people and standby was essentially pointless for me. While waiting in line at customer service, there was a gentleman in front of me who was traveling with his wife and baby. Again, the airline refused to offer him a discount for a hotel, a refund or credit. The man (who was a black man —coincidence? I’ll let you decide.) never once raised his voice or got aggressive. He simply pleaded for the airline to do something to help him and his family. Instead the attendant got angry at him and yelled at him that he had two options “book a different airline or take the Tuesday flight. Do you want us to risk your life flying in bad weather?!” Very unprofessional. The man in front of me then frustratingly walked away and the airline called the police on him to have him arrested. Unbelievable. The flight attendant said he had been working since 4 am and was too tired for this. Thankfully, my mother was able to speak to the police and calm down the situation so that they understood the customer did nothing wrong. When it was my turn to speak with an agent, I was met with inconsiderate agents who kept saying they just wanted to walk away or tell everyone to go away because this was frustrating for them too. I agree, it was a stressful situation for everyone involved. However, it is unprofessional and extremely inconsiderate to say that to passengers who are now having to book an extra 3 night stay over the weekend in Nashville where the minimum is a couple hundred a night for a room. American Airlines is a billion dollar corporation. They could have compensated for customer troubles at least a little bit. I am absolutely appalled by the experience and customer service.","I have had the worst experience with American Airlines this weekend trying to get back home to DC from Nashville.

"✅ Trip Verified | I am sitting at the Chicago Airport, when I should be visiting family in IN. I arrived here from WA state at about 11.20. When I got off the plane, I checked the reader board to find the gate, for my next flight to Indianapolis. It was gate H2. I got to the gate around 11.30, and told the AA representative that I still needed a seat assignment for flight 4143, boarding at 12.05. She printed out a boarding pass with a seat assignment and gate H2, posted on the pass. At 12.20, I looked up from my reading and overheard two men talking. One man had just received a message on his phone that the gate had changed to G8. I had signed up for flight information updates also, but got no message. The three of us ran to gate G8 where the plane still was, but the door to the ramp was closed. We explained to the AA rep, that we had no idea the gate had changed until just a few minutes ago. She literally said, ""I made one overhead announcement around 11.20 and that is all I am required to do."" They would not open the door for us to get on the plane. A manager, also told me that they had given sufficient notice and 42 of the 45 people on the flight had managed to make it on the plane. We were all booked standby for a 5.00 pm flight, with seats on an 8.00 pm flight, if needed. I suggested that, in the future, when they changed gates and they had the names of patients that they knew had arrived on prior flights, that had not arrived at the gate yet, they actually page those individuals by name. ""That is a great idea, we will do that the next time"" was his response. My daughter happened to be one of the 42. I found out from her, later, that her flight from Austin had arrived late, so she ran to gate G8 (by this time the reader board had been updated). When she got to the gate, they scanned her boarding pass, and asked her to wait with a small group of people waiting for them to reopen the closed door, to access the plane. Seems like 42 people didn't arrive without any problem.","I am sitting at the Chicago Airport, when I should be visiting family in IN. I arrived here from WA state at about 11.20.

"✅ Trip Verified |  What a disappointment. It’s almost unreal how bad this flight and customer service was. Not only was our first AA flight delayed 40 minutes for “maintenance paperwork” but then the connecting flight was either not told or didn’t care that the original flight was late, so more than a dozen people sprinted through DFW only to arrive at the gate 10 minutes before takeoff and be told (even though the plane was still there) that the gate closed five minutes ago and there “was nothing they could do.” Not only is that not true it is not helpful. Speaking of not helpful, rebooking a flight was completely driven by me - no one offered to help all of the stranded people at DFW who missed their connections (again due to AA being late, not us). I ended up flying back to Austin because there were no additional flights for more than 12 hours. On that flight, I was shocked to learn that we were waiting 30-40 more minutes so that “we can get everyone to Austin we can because this is the last flight.” What? Where was this idea of waiting - regardless of people on board - for all of the people on our first AA flight that missed their last flight of the day to their final destination? Absolutely surreal. I will never fly AA again and I will absolutely recommend to everyone I speak to to avoid this airline.","What a disappointment. It’s almost unreal how bad this flight and customer service was.

"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is awful. Do not use at all, especially if not a direct flight. My family was returning home from Orlando and just before boarding was to begin we were notified that the plane was running a few minutes late but connecting flights should be fine. Then we were told it would be a few more minuets because the plane landed on the wrong side of the airport. Once we finally got on the storm front had reached us, around 30 min after we were supposed to already be in the air. 3 hrs later we were forced to deplane. By this time our connecting flight was already gone. American Airlines logged the delay as due to weather and refused to book us on another airline so we were forced to take our first flight to Charlotte, 5 hrs after the original time, or risk not getting out from Orlando until Monday, 5 days later. Now that we are here there are no flights where we can stay together to travel so I have to take one of our 5 year olds to Phoenix for a 6.5 hr layover before finally getting to Minneapolis. My wife and our other two children have to sit at the airport from hotel check out till 4pm before their flight. American Airlines seems to have just used the weather to their advantage to get an easy out so my choices would be to fork out 4000 to fly home via delta with a 1 hr layover or take what American gave us.

They said my bank disputed the charge of $13.80 which was the difference of the trip credit I had to pay. My bank can’t dispute a charge unless I request a dispute. I had to purchase another ticket for more cost. I was trying to go home to my cousins funeral so I had to purchase a ticket. American Airlines made my trip worst.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I don’t even know where to begin with this huge travel fiasco I had to endure with a baby in tow.  American canceled our flights due to weather on 2/25/22. Okay, fine. We tried rebooking on the app several times, the flights kept disappearing and we get error messages. Call times were over 5 hrs. Finally get a call back from an agent the next day. The earliest she could rebook us for was 3/1 (four days after our original departure). In the meantime we’ve tried rebooking other airlines, and same error message kept happening. Not to mention flights were four times the cost with 11hr or more flight times as opposed to the 5 hr flight time we originally booked. We keep calling every day between Friday and Tuesday to see if anything else had opened up - nothing. Now we’re stuck in Miami for four additional days - racking up costs on hotel, meals, car rental, gas, diapers, etc.  We check in for our flights on the app Monday night and seats are confirmed. When we arrive at the airport two hrs early on Tuesday, the agent says we don’t have tickets. When she reviews our history, she notices the agent that rebooked us forgot to reissue our tickets. The agent puts us on standby.  When we get to the counter at the gate and explain our situation to the agent there, she says we have to wait, so we do. We later realize that the agent starts giving away seats to customers flying solo as they become available instead of following protocol (wait until all paying customers are checked in and then go down the standby list in order - we were the top 3 on the list). We ask her why and she says because they are in a rush and need to board the plane. That they cannot afford to wait for 3 seats to open up, they must give them away asap. Although 3 seats eventually became available, because the agent failed to follow protocol, we didn’t make the flight.  We return to the original check in agent and explain what happened. She was confused and confirmed that the staff person did not follow proper standby protocol. She rebooks us for the following day on Wednesday morning but cannot sit us together. I ask her about hotel and meal vouchers and she said she cannot do anything and for us to file a complaint. Yet another night at a hotel, missing work, school, and meal expenses. We arrive at the airport two hours early on the day of our flight so that we can speak to the agent at the counter about sitting us next to our two year old son. The agent says they cannot do anything for us and to “figure it out” when we board the plane with other passengers. We were so distraught by their refusal to help us that two passengers then volunteered to move so that we can be seated with our 2 year old. It was only at that point that Victor (the agent at the counter who refused to help us) then proceeded to change our seats. AA doesn’t care about families. AA doesn’t care about customers. All they care about is their bottom line $$$. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and empathy, gross negligence, refusal to follow proper protocols, refusal to provide customers with hotel and meal vouchers when they were the ones who messed up.

I'm also confused how our flight was scheduled to depart at 06.00am but didn't depart until over an hour late especially when there was no reported weather or mechanical issues. Matter of fact the plane was parked at the departure gate for 6 hours prior to the scheduled departure. Than when we boarded the plane my spouse asked if they had any alcohol cleaning wipes because of COVID-19, the flight attendant said that they were out. I think this was a lie because this was the first flight of the day for this crew and plane. Lastly it is very disappointing that the AA policy regarding military boarding priority is only for active duty members that are in uniform.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible service. Missed a connecting flight by 1 minute due to 1st leg being delayed. Paid $100's of extra dollars to fly into small airport instead of being picked up in Dallas in order to save time.

Ridiculous that they could not let us on that close due to their fault. Staff was unhelpful and rude. They could not care less. No compensation just ""tough luck"". Never ever will I fly this airline again which is a big deal since they are the only airline that flies into a place I need to go.

"✅ Trip Verified |  If I have a choice, I always avoid American. Flew from Columbus to Miami in January. Zero service in First Class. Not even a snack basket. Horrible. Today I’m flying from Miami to Aspen. Internet wasn’t even working. The entertainment worked, but it cut out 3 times during 90 minute movie. Had to start completely over 3 times after a 10 minute blackout. The worst part about flying American is their access to the Admiral Club for my 2 hour layover. No access for First Class passengers.

I used to fly a lot on American but could never use the miles I earned because of all their restrictions. Fours years ago I decided to give them another chance. Two years ago we had our annual trip to a Sandals planned and had to cancel due to Covid-19. At the time we had reserved two round trip tickets from Phoenix.

"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines lost my stroller/carseat on our way to Disneyworld, in July 2021, they did not have a loaner stroller small enough for my six week old infant. I was forced to rent an infant stroller from the parks out of pocket. When my stroller/carseat we’re finally found and brought to us the brand new car seat had multiple tears in the fabric, the stroller was stained with grease. I was annoyed that a $400 travel system that had only been used twice was trashed but I was grateful to no longer have to pay for rentals. On our way back home to Palm Springs my stroller was destroyed. It was returned to me with multiple pieces missing from the canopy and the bassinet/seat of the stroller, the wheels were also broken. I immediately contacted customer service and I was told that I needed to reach out to the stroller manufacturer to see if they were able to send me replacement pieces, the pieces needed were out of stock until April 2022. I informed American Airlines of this fact, they told me I needed a letter starting that because replacement pieces weren’t available that I needed a replacement stroller. After reaching out to the manufacturer for several months I was finally given the necessary letter in November 2021. I forwarded the letter to American Airlines customer service, I did not hear back from them until mid February 2022. They informed me that I didn’t get the letter within 30 days of the date I filed the claim so they would be denying my claim to replace the stroller they soiled and broke. Not only did I go back and forth between both companies for months and had to wait several months for replies from each company due to everyone being understaffed but I was shocked that I was not reimbursed for the rental strollers nor was my $400 travel system replaced by American Airlines. I will never fly with them again and I don’t suggest you trust them with you baby stuff, the fact that hazardous airplane grease was all over my baby’s was disgusting but they also lost several pieces of the stroller and took no accountability.","American Airlines lost my stroller/carseat on our way to Disneyworld, in July 2021, they did not have a loaner stroller small enough for my six week old infant.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The day before my flight I got an email from American to arrive 2 hours early (domestic flight). I arrived 1.5 hours early and there were no agents at the counter and lights and computers weren’t even on for 15 more min.

When we finally rebooked we are rushed on and I had 30 min to connect at the next airport. We then spend 40 min on the plane because they are having issues with checked bags, even though at this point they have had 4 hours plus to figure out the bag situation.

"✅ Trip Verified | It’s a quiet Saturday morning, after perhaps the most frustrating and difficult experience of a lifetime yesterday. Tina, Nicole, and I began our day yesterday morning by getting ourselves to the Asheville Airport for our two legged trip to Las Vegas and then driving to Zion National Park for our son, Bryson's, wedding this morning! When we arrived at the Asheville desk of American Airlines, we were told that our flight to Charlotte was running late, but not to worry, we would arrive in plenty of time for our connection to Las Vegas. As that flight became later, we were informed by the tickets agent at the gate that we were not going to make our connection. American had two more flights yesterday from Charlotte to Vegas and she said that we were in the numbers one, two, and three spots on stand by. She then stated with all of the delays they were experiencing in the system, we were a shoe in for the next flight. We decided to go ahead on to Charlotte and wait for the next flight four hours later. Well, that flight was over sold and we didn’t get on that flight. The next flight was two hours later and we were met with the same fate on that one, a no go! When confronting American Airlines service, informing them that we have now missed our sons wedding, and we are in Charlotte, where we don’t live, they simply throw their hands up and tell us that we’re on our own from here! To make things even more difficult, we wait around for over two hours trying to recover our luggage. That too was a failed effort and our luggage as of this morning is still somewhere in the American Airlines system between Charlotte and Las Vegas? We had to rent a car, drive home and get here at 1.30am. We will complete the drive to Asheville this morning to go and retrieve our car, and the family of the groom will miss the wedding. The most aggravating factor is, as we found out, our original flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we probably did arrive in Charlotte in time to make that flight. It is my belief that the flight was over sold and they chose not to inform us that we were going to make the flight so that they could accommodate other passengers that were waiting for that over sold flight as well. Instead of asking for us to volunteer to step off, and because we were in Asheville, they just didn’t tell us the flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we were going to make it! Every single correspondence with American personnel was difficult and frustrating. They have no concept of service nor do they care. This is the second time in a row that we have flown American and ended up getting stranded and having to rent a car to drive with no consideration from American. I was interrupted while writing this to answer the American Airlines service representatives call. I conveyed to her, just now, this exact same story of yesterday’s mis adventures, and you cannot possibly believe this, she asked me what it is that I am asking of her?! No offer of refund, no apology, no mention of compensations for the days expenses, a big fat nothing! I have flown American Airlines my entire life. This is two trips in a row that this airline has fumbled, and the nightmare of a lifetime of missing our sons wedding! I will never have anything to do with American Airlines ever again. I strongly advise anyone to give due consideration before choosing American Airlines for travel!","It’s a quiet Saturday morning, after perhaps the most frustrating and difficult experience of a lifetime yesterday. Tina, Nicole, and I began our day yesterday morning by getting ourselves to the Asheville Airport for our two legged trip to Las Vegas and then driving to Zion National Park for our son, Bryson's, wedding this morning! When we arrived at the Asheville desk of American Airlines, we were told that our flight to Charlotte was running late, but not to worry, we would arrive in plenty of time for our connection to Las Vegas. As that flight became later, we were informed by the tickets agent at the gate that we were not going to make our connection. American had two more flights yesterday from Charlotte to Vegas and she said that we were in the numbers one, two, and three spots on stand by. She then stated with all of the delays they were experiencing in the system, we were a shoe in for the next flight. We decided to go ahead on to Charlotte and wait for the next flight four hours later. Well, that flight was over sold and we didn’t get on that flight. The next flight was two hours later and we were met with the same fate on that one, a no go! When confronting American Airlines service, informing them that we have now missed our sons wedding, and we are in Charlotte, where we don’t live, they simply throw their hands up and tell us that we’re on our own from here! To make things even more difficult, we wait around for over two hours trying to recover our luggage. That too was a failed effort and our luggage as of this morning is still somewhere in the American Airlines system between Charlotte and Las Vegas? We had to rent a car, drive home and get here at 1.30am. We will complete the drive to Asheville this morning to go and retrieve our car, and the family of the groom will miss the wedding. The most aggravating factor is, as we found out, our original flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we probably did arrive in Charlotte in time to make that flight. It is my belief that the flight was over sold and they chose not to inform us that we were going to make the flight so that they could accommodate other passengers that were waiting for that over sold flight as well. Instead of asking for us to volunteer to step off, and because we were in Asheville, they just didn’t tell us the flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we were going to make it! Every single correspondence with American personnel was difficult and frustrating. They have no concept of service nor do they care.

"Not Verified |  My flight from Pensacola to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes due to plane maintenance. I asked the desk attendants and flight attendants if I'd be able to make my connection to Nassau with AA because that only left me 30 minutes between landing and take off. There were problems and delays getting off the plane, and I missed the doors to my connecting flight to Nassau by 2 minutes. They would not let me on the plane, and could not guarantee me a flight to Nassau this weekend because they were all booked. The attendants did not care about my situation. They simply kept saying there was nothing they could do, talk to this person. I keep getting passed on to the ""next person"" who is supposed to be able to help me yet I've gotten no help. I'm on standby, and this next flight is now also delayed. I keep being told conflicting advice, saying I'm able to have tickets refunded, but then I'm not eligible without canceling the remainder of my flights even though they are completely separate itineraries. I'm beyond frustrated. I'm pregnant and traveling alone and this just isn't acceptable. This was my first time flying on American airlines and I will never fly with this company again. I want my money back for these tickets.","My flight from Pensacola to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes due to plane maintenance.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly American again and I could cite my recent trip to Orlando as the reason why as I found my checked luggage to be damage and unusable except the return flight to Phoenix was even worse. The staff on the plane are unpersonable in my opinion. The safety demo is a recording and not a flight attendant like the other airline I travel. We land in Phoenix about on normal time despite a delay out of Orlando. I go to the baggage claim carousel to wait for my 3 bags (2 luggage, ((1 new because of the damage on the flight there) and 1 car seat). The 2 bags come out no problem but no sign of car seat which is in a bag for added protection. After about 20 minutes my wife goes to baggage assistance to see if size is an issue. They say it'll be on the carousel, after another 15 minutes the carousel stops turning. My turn to go into the baggage assistance where they cant go by name but a number on the tag which they issue when I check in so why cant they check by name. She needs the tags so I grab the bag that was in my name as my wife had her bag and the car seat was in my name so I only needed mine. The lady is a little incompetent on that and thinks I'm missing 2 bags so I have to explain it to her again. There also is no concern on their part that I cant leave the airport as I don't have my car seat. She just smiles and happily says were trying and no sorry or nothing. In her calls I learn it was scanned off the plane at 1045am, its currently 1120am when I'm talking with this lady and still no car seat. It finally pops onto the carousel at 1123am so almost 45 mins for a car seat to get to baggage claim when my other bags were there in 5-10 minutes. Unacceptable and delaying my 2 hour drive home and finally a sorry you had to wait as I walked to retrieve my car seat. I will pay double or triple before I fly American again.","I will never fly American again and I could cite my recent trip to Orlando as the reason why as I found my checked luggage to be damage and unusable except the return flight to Phoenix was even worse.

Not Verified | The worst airline I have ever experienced! We had just about every bad thing that can happen to you on a flight experience happen to us on this trip. All the nightmares I hear about airlines came through from American on our way home from Florida. They rearranged our flight adding and extra layover and changing what should have been a 5 hour flight into a 7 hour. That was just the first part! During this change I was I. The phone with several customer service reps as our casual 11am flight time was changed to a grueling 3am time. I had several customer service reps easing there voice at me on the phone! We ultimately had to take the flight as is with nothing done about it. Get to the airport that day get on the first of what is now 3 flights. This flight lands and they delay the next one several hours until all of us on the flight miss the connection in the next airport. A customer service rep at the airport yelled at my fiancé! I called in again and was told they couldn’t do anything once again. We get to the next airport and running to catch the last flight we miss it due to the delay. We are then told they are not going to give us anything a hotel or new flight nothing. They finally find a United flight that my group and the other groups can fly to get home. Turning what should have been a 5 hour trip into 18 hours of travel. We then arrive home where my family had been waiting 5 hours to pick us up and our bags are not there. Customer service is also closed at this time. I call they say we will have to come back to the airport to get our bags the next day. Driving an hour out of my way to get my bags and one of them the entire back is torn off of it. They refuse to replace it and United steps in and offers to replace it.

"Not Verified | I fly a lot. I’ve flown 3-5 times a year domestically and internationally for most of my life. I’ve had many horrible experiences with planes - delays, cancelled flights, etc. But, I’ve never experienced the absolute disaster that is American Airlines. It’s not the service. It’s the physical planes. My first flight COU to IAH was delayed due to mechanical issues (which they blamed on cold weather which the pilot told us wasn’t true- disgusting behavior by the airline). We were strung along for several hours that a rescue plane was coming. By the time they said we should rebook, all the decent flights were no longer an option. I would’ve had to fly to Dallas late then Houston the next morning. Family ended up driving 4 hours to pick me up because the airline wouldn’t give me a hotel voucher. I flew out of COU 13 hours late (the plane I was rebooked on was delayed as well). Flying home, I left from BTR and that flight was also delayed due to mechanical issues. We left 5 hours late. I missed my connection to COU, so was stuck in Dallas for 10 hours waiting for my flight. No food vouchers of course because it ‘wasn’t their fault’. My plane to COU was then delayed again. I didn’t get home until we’ll after 1am. I was supposed to be home before noon. I had to be up for work at 4am. Zero apologizes from the airline besides ‘sorry for the inconvenience but maintenance isn’t our problem’. Yes maintenance is your problem. The number of planes with mechanical issues I had makes me very reluctant to ever fly with this airline again. They can’t maintain their planes. They don’t notice issues until their passengers are about to board- and these are first flight of the day planes too. There’s plenty of time to check the plane after a flight to be ready for the next day. In my line of work, not checking your equipment would lead to people being fired. Maybe that needs to start happening in aviation. It’s not hard to check the plane after a flight. And if your planes are breaking down this frequently, maybe there’s a bigger problem. Also the complete lack of support for passengers being stranded (many people I flew with were forced to get hotel rooms and the airline offered zero help) is appalling. I’m in the service industry. I’d never dream of treating people like this. I won’t be flying American Airlines again.","I fly a lot. I’ve flown 3-5 times a year domestically and internationally for most of my life.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with American Airlines before and had a decent experience but I am currently in the middle of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My husband and I were trying to return from vacation to Orlando back to Detroit. We arrived at Orlando International Airport for our flight scheduled with American Airlines, checked in and proceeded to the gate. When it became time to board they came over the PA and made and made an announcement that the flight might be canceled because they had no flight attendants. We were told to proceed to the desk for rebooting. After waiting in line for 2 hours we were given the only flight they could give us 2 days later and given meal vouchers, hotel vouchers and 2 cab vouchers. We got to the hotel and felt that maybe things would be ok. In the morning we went down to eat breakfast and were told that our meal vouchers were being declined. There were several people in the restaurant having the very same problem. We had to pay $30 out of own pocket for the worst breakfast ever since we had no car to go elsewhere. Next we tried to book a cab for the morning of our rescheduled flight and the voucher we were given was only good for 24 hours and they knew full well when giving it to us that we were delayed for 2 days. We then were forced to pay another fifty dollars for the cab for the airport after having to buy our own meals for 2 days. When I called customer service and explained the situation I was told that the only way I could straighten it out was to go to the airport to customer service (which would be a $50 cab ride and 25 minute trip each way. I explained this to the manager on duty over the phone and was told there was nothing she could do to help me. I am still in a hotel and hoping to get out in the morning if they do not cancel again. I am very shocked at the lack of caring on their part and I was only one if many people they did thIs to in my hotel. ","I have flown with American Airlines before and had a decent experience but I am currently in the middle of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My husband and I were trying to return from vacation to Orlando back to Detroit. We arrived at Orlando International Airport for our flight scheduled with American Airlines, checked in and proceeded to the gate. When it became time to board they came over the PA and made and made an announcement that the flight might be canceled because they had no flight attendants. We were told to proceed to the desk for rebooting. After waiting in line for 2 hours we were given the only flight they could give us 2 days later and given meal vouchers, hotel vouchers and 2 cab vouchers. We got to the hotel and felt that maybe things would be ok. In the morning we went down to eat breakfast and were told that our meal vouchers were being declined. There were several people in the restaurant having the very same problem. We had to pay $30 out of own pocket for the worst breakfast ever since we had no car to go elsewhere. Next we tried to book a cab for the morning of our rescheduled flight and the voucher we were given was only good for 24 hours and they knew full well when giving it to us that we were delayed for 2 days. We then were forced to pay another fifty dollars for the cab for the airport after having to buy our own meals for 2 days. When I called customer service and explained the situation I was told that the only way I could straighten it out was to go to the airport to customer service (which would be a $50 cab ride and 25 minute trip each way. I explained this to the manager on duty over the phone and was told there was nothing she could do to help me. I am still in a hotel and hoping to get out in the morning if they do not cancel again. I am very shocked at the lack of caring on their part and I was only one if many people they did thIs to in my hotel.",2024-08-10,LAX-JFK,Leisure,None,Staff Service,0.03152263374485597
"Not Verified |  This review refers more to American's refund policy than the actual flight I took. I find it an airline like most of the rest with little interest in the customer. No better, no worse than the other major US airlines. I do find their $60 fee for first bag excessive. Because of covid the airlines are trying to attract customers by offering lenient cancellation terms. I want people to know that American's terms include the following as I recently had to cancel a trip due to covid. This is what I found in my particular case, but I suggest any flyer should check their situation before booking. 1) The cancellation fee in my situation was $200 per ticket. This can add up if you are flying with multiple people. 2) I had the option to change my dates at no charge, but if you booked at a higher rate, you get no refund if your follow up trip is less. 3) You can get a voucher towards future travel (as they call it) implying that you have the full fare to use as you want. Your travel must be completed prior to the date you originally purchases the tickets. So in other words, if you purchased your Christmas tickets early say, July and you cancel. You have to complete our trip prior to July in order to use the voucher. It should, be like for like, either you book within one year of your original booking date or you need to complete travel by the end date of the cancelled reservation. 4) In addition to this restriction the small print tells you that this voucher is only good for one trip and only for the original passengers. So if you had a trip to Europe scheduled for $2000 for you and your husband and you want to fly with your daughter to visit another daughter in the US. You would need to pay for your daughter's ticket and you would lose the balance of the voucher which will probably be in excess of $1000. I understand that the airlines are in tight straights but they can do something more to help passengers with rescheduling flights.","This review refers more to American's refund policy than the actual flight I took.

"Not Verified | I purchased airfare from American Airlines to fly from Fargo ND to Dallas TX, with a connecting flight in Minneapolis on 1/7/22 and returning on 1/9/22. The evening before my fight I was notified that my flight was cancelled. The only option provided for an alternate departing flight was on 1/9. This is the date I was to return and not acceptable. Instead I flew out of Minneapolis and drove there. There is an extra cost to purchase a round trip from Fargo to Minneapolis. I contacted American customer support and requested a refund for the cost of the airfare from Fargo to Minneapolis. The rep denied my claim because of weather that cancelled the flight from Fargo. It was very cold this day. However, other airlines flew out of Fargo that day. They did not provide the service I paid for in flying me from Fargo to Minneapolis. Their customer service is terrible.

The evening before my fight I was notified that my flight was cancelled. The only option provided for an alternate departing flight was on 1/9. This is the date I was to return and not acceptable. Instead I flew out of Minneapolis and drove there. There is an extra cost to purchase a round trip from Fargo to Minneapolis. I contacted American customer support and requested a refund for the cost of the airfare from Fargo to Minneapolis. The rep denied my claim because of weather that cancelled the flight from Fargo. It was very cold this day. However, other airlines flew out of Fargo that day. They did not provide the service I paid for in flying me from Fargo to Minneapolis. Their customer service is terrible.

✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever! Because the Miami security check took 1 1/2 hours to get through we missed our flight. We then had to wait in line another 1 1/2 hours in the Rebooking line located in the terminal next to our gate. My first clue was that a Rebooking desk existed at all. I’ve never seen this with any other airline I’ve used. 50 people were already in line ahead of us and soon another 50 were behind us.  What should have been a direct 3 1/2 hour flight turned out to be an all day marathon at 3 different airports. I suggest you avoid this airline at all costs.,Worst airline ever!

"✅ Trip Verified | Having recently had a great experience (see my review below) I unfortunately had a mediocre one on this trip. Same aircraft, same great seat but on this 3 hour flight extremely bad service. The crew was not unfriendly but totally did the minimum after the initial drink and (cold) meal service I was never checked on again. More importantly there was no pre landing safety check at all. That is serious and unforgivable. To top it off the flight came into the Tom Bradley Terminal and there was no direction about the 25 minute walk to baggage claim in Terminal 4. After the long walk there was still a long wait for the luggage delivery. I guess my last flight was a fluke.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying American's Flagship First is the best end-to-end experience on offer by any US airline. They are the only US-based carrier flying 3 and 4 cabin aircraft with a true first class, and the only one offering a premium ground experience and first class lounge. The experience can vary widely from one crew to another, but I'm generally pleased more often than not. For this flight, I was staying at the TWA Hotel at JFK's Terminal 5, just a short walk and ride on the AirTrain from American's location in Terminal 8. I headed to the terminal about 2.5 hours before boarding to enjoy the lounges and get a bite to eat. I skipped the dedicated First Class check-in counter at Terminal 8 since I already held my boarding pass and was not checking bags. There was no line for PreCheck, and within 5 minutes of arriving at the terminal, I was airside and in the elevator to the Admirals Club in Concourse B, which is home to the Flagship Lounge and Flagship First Dining facilities. I was greeted by the lounge attendant and immediately invited to follow her to the Flagship First dining room, which is within the Flagship Lounge, within the Admirals Club. A lounge, within a lounge, within a lounge - a third-level of exclusivity, which is pretty cool and unique among US-based airlines. I was seated and handed an a la carte food menu and wine list, both of which were quite impressive. The food was outstanding, as was the wine selection on offer, including Laurent-Perrier Grans Siecle Champagne (retails at $160/bottle). Approximately 10 minutes before boarding, I headed to the C Concourse and arrived at the gate about 5 minutes after boarding started to find that they had most of the passengers already onboard this half-empty flight. I arrived at my seat, 2F, finding two pillows, a duvet, and blanket, along with a bottle of water and a basic Shinola branded amenity kit. Immediately upon settling in, a very kind flight attendant handed me a pair of Bang and Olufsen noise canceling headphones and took my order for a pre-departure drink (yes, this is still on offer in F cabin, even during service reductions for COVID) - I naturally chose the Champagne, which was not on par with that served in the Flagship First dining room, but still very good. The first class seat itself on the A321T is one of the best seats on any American aircraft, and is a modification of the seat in the business cabin on their 777-300ER fleet. It is a reverse-herringbone 1-1 layout across five rows for a total of ten seats in the cabin. The opportunity to fly in a reverse-herringbone seat on a narrowbody aircraft is such a great experience, and the most exclusive-feeling cabin you can find. The fact that this route serves a lot of NBC Universal traffic only adds to that experience, as many passengers in F cabin are A list celebrities. The flight attendant working F on this flight was very friendly and attentive, keeping glasses full and passengers feeling like they are truly traveling in a premium cabin. The food was again restaurant-quality, with first courses being served separately from the main course. As an aside, AA was supposed to be implementing ""reduced"" service in all cabins due to the Omicron surge, however, that was definitively not the experience on this flight. Bravo to American Airlines for keeping the product and level of service outstanding, and a truly first class experience.","Flying American's Flagship First is the best end-to-end experience on offer by any US airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  SFO-JFK in January 2022. AA operates 16 A321 Transcontinental aircraft with a premium configuration including 10 seats in the F cabin which stand up to the best international business class seats currently flying, and 20 seats in the J cabin in a 2-2 layout with ample space and fully lie-flat. This review is of the J cabin. The only drawback to SFO is that it lacks a Flagship Lounge or any first-class check-in facilities. I was able to access the Alaska lounge in Terminal 2 because I arrived on a United flight, which connects to T2 from T3. I had to take the AirTrain to Terminal 1. All that said, American's ownership of the B gates at SFO is a really nice upgrade over their previous location in Terminal 2, which was itself a very nice terminal. The Admirals Club at SFO is among the cleanest and newest among the network and stands up to those at JFK, ORD, and the best at DFW, and far better than those at PHX, DCA, and most at CLT and LAX. The Harvey Milk Terminal is a beautiful point of departure and among the very best in the entire AA network. Purchased an economy ticket and was upgraded as an Executive Platinum member. Ground and cabin crew on American are traditional and business-like, often with few pleasantries, but usually efficient.  This flight was no exception. Roughly 10 minutes after departure, hot towels were offered, followed by drink orders. Two minutes later I received warm nuts and a glass of very drinkable champagne. My appetizer arrived approximately 25 minutes after takeoff, consisting of an arugula and strawberry salad and tomato and mozzarella salad. It was very edible but could have been served as a single dish. The flight attendant waited until I had finished my first course then brought my main - sea bass, which was truly restaurant-quality. A glass of South African Viognier to accompany the bass. A caramel sundae and Desorono to cap off the meal, followed by coffee. Perfect. Another few drinks, a cookie, a couple hours of work later and it's time to descend to JFK.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Connecting flight from Alaska Airlines, which is partnered with American. Alaska arranged this flight for me. I had checked in online with both Alaska and American 24 hours prior. I had printed my boarding passes and baggage ticket from kiosk in Santa Rosa airport. When I get to Los Angeles, and go to American Eagle gate, I am told the boarding pass was not the right pass. I was then asked for my passport, as I was listed as an 'international traveler', for no apparent reason. I explained I did not have my passport, that I had not flown outside the country. I was then asked where I was flying from Denver, and I explained Denver was my home destination. This required multiple conferences with their co-worker, and a few phone calls. Finally allowed on plane for my first class seat, one of the last to board. This was a needless delay, and made no sense to anyone. Not only that, but my suitcase did not transfer even though the baggage ticket plainly stated it was to go to Los Angeles and then to Denver. It stayed in Los Angeles, and has been to North Carolina and back in the past day. Very bad connecting flight experience, I wish Alaska did not partner with American. Also, other minor annoyances; when I arrived at the first gate for transfer to American Eagle, I was not aware the doors would open and I would be herded on to a bus, even though I had gone to the counter agent earlier to make sure I was at the correct gate. It's not a problem if only someone there had mentioned to me the routine. As it was, I was confused and inwardly doubting I was in the right area as everyone else on the bus seemed to be going to Portland. A simple explanation would have gone a long way with me late at night in an unfamiliar setting. Another minor annoyance: I was not aware that the Admiral lounge was only for first class passengers that were on 'flagship' airplanes, and not for American Eagle. No where on the website had I read that (maybe I didn't see it), and instead had the impression that Alaska Airlines first class passengers were also able to use the 'partner' American Airlines Admiral lounge.

Today we we’re traveling from Rochester MN to Ohare in Chicago to catch a direct flight from Chicago to Palm Springs. our flight was delayed and landed in Ohare 40 or so minutes late, we got to the gate H 4 , 8 to 10 minutes before departure time for our Palm Springs flight & it was gone. With further investigation we found they admitted pushing away early & bragging about arriving 30 minutes early in Palm Springs! Don’t say you weren’t warned! If they were the last airline on earth I just wouldn’t fly.",2023-11-30,MIA-GRU,Business,None,Flight Delay,0.03509615384615384

Today I had to fly from Fort Wayne stop in Dallas to San Antonio with my 1 year old so I have a cat seat and a stroller so I go to the agent to tag my stroller and this lady says have a seat the ticket agent will tag it. My group board is called, I line up get to the ticket agent and this person says I have to get out of line to go back to the same person who told me to have a seat in the first place to get my stroller tagged. To add insult to the injury they tell me they are putting my stroller and cat seat to go to baggage claim!  I said needed it getting off the plane to seat the baby so the women says ok, so baggage claim or you don’t fly!

Not Verified | The airline attendants are awesome they went out of their way to make me feel comfortable after speaking to and knowing that my dad passed away. Both my flights were great. Although the bag handlers on the ground need to be more careful with people's things they broke my bag but that has nothing to do with American Airlines. I have to say their customer service was too notch. ,The airline attendants are awesome they went out of their way to make me feel comfortable after speaking to and knowing that my dad passed away.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid at all costs. Booked 11:20am flight from Sydney > Los Angeles > Dallas. 7pm the evening before I get an email to say my connecting flight from LA to Dallas has been booked at a later time because my Sydney to Los Angeles flight has been delayed. I logon to AA website and see estimated departure time has changed from 11:20am to 9:30pm, a delay of over 9 hours. I called as the booking still said 11:20am but estimated change to 930pm. As it is the night before the flight, obviously concerned about plans for the following day. The customer service representative assures me the flight has been delayed to 930pm and will not fly at 11:20am as scheduled. At this point the flight shows estimated departure 930pm and am assured by customer service it is now a 930pm departure which is why they also changed my flight from LAX to Dallas to a 9 hour later flight. I wake up in the morning and at 8am get a text to say my flight is now departing at 11:20am. As I required a PCR test before boarding there is obviously no chance of making this flight. I call customer service. They tell me the flight is 11:20am and that there was never any change more or less politely suggesting that I either made a mistake or am lying. I logon to my AA flight and it shows 11:20am, no reference to 930pm anywhere. Luckily, I still had the tab open in my browser and I can get a screenshot showing 930pm. After taking the screenshot, I refresh the browser and the 930pm reference disappears. The muppets at AA suggest a new booking. Now they want me to fly from Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Dallas with between 4 and 6 hour stop overs at each destination (not to mention the 4 or 5 hours including PCR test at airport before the first flight). I say no, please book next direct flight to LA (next day). So they do.. and then half hour after booking a new email from AA ''your flight has been delayed and you may not make your connecting flight''. Now going through exactly the same thing again. I am now phoning customer service requesting they book me with another airline (Qantas maybe?) that has some idea of how an airline. I understand times are difficult and unpredictable. The insulting part was suggesting that none of this ever happened and that my flight was always 11:20am and being absolutely unapologetic about their own incompetence. I would never fly or recommend this airline to anyone.","Avoid at all costs.

"Not Verified |  Miami to New York JFK. I am so pleased with American Airline rebooking station in Miami FL. After our flight was cancelled from Miami to Hartford (1/16/22) due to weather, we were so upset considering we were traveling with my 82 year old (handicapped) mother. They spent a lot of time trying to resolve our flight situation so we could get back home ASAP. Above all else they were super accommodating and understanding towards my mothers situation. They went above and beyond to find us the soonest flight to the closest airport near Hartford, while also providing us with travel, meal and stay vouchers to accommodate my mothers situation. I tried my best to tip them for the help and great attitude but they would not accept explaining that it was part of the  job and they were happy to help. I understand how short staffed the world is nowadays. Thank you for getting us home safe.","Miami to New York JFK. I am so pleased with American Airline rebooking station in Miami FL.

"Not Verified |  First time flying AA in a while and will never fly again after this experience. First, my departing flight from Hartford, CT to Madison, WI was involuntarily moved from 6.45 pm to 7 hours earlier to 12.30pm that afternoon for no reason or consent. I had to readjust my entire work schedule after being unable to change it back. Then my returning flight back was canceled for no shared reason, which I was informed of through text. This left me on the phone for 2 hours waiting to talk to customer service to rebook my flight. Once rebooked, my returning flight was then subsequently delayed 3 hours for no shared reason. Pathetic customer service, unreliable flights, and a waste of my money.","First time flying AA in a while and will never fly again after this experience.
